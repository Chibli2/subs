00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,510
<i>Baek In Ho.</i>

00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,500
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

6
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:24,070
Do you want to play the piano?

7
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,310
I asked if you wanted to play the piano.

8
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,850
Sunbae, why are you suddenly asking him that?

9
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,210
What are you two doing here?

10
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:51,940
Professor Sim Myeong Soo asked me to give this to you.

11
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,640
It seems like you have some lingering feelings left since you're hanging around here.

12
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,150
Be quiet. Why should it matter to you whatever I do?

13
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,140
Go study abroad. I'll support you.

14
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,410
That's hilarious.

15
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,850
I'm saying this because it seems like you've changed your mind.

16
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,110
If it's because of your pride that you're unable to agree, you don't have to be like that.

17
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,170
Sunbae.

18
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,180
Why are you speaking to him like that?

19
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,570
What about it?

20
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:32,010
It sounds like you're trying to pick a fight with him.

21
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,430
You only needed to say that you received a card

22
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,770
and give it to him. Then tell him, "Go and meet with him".

23
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,800
That's all you needed to do. Why would you suddenly bring up studying abroad?

24
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,990
You are skilled enough to study abroad. I'm doing this because I feel that it's a pity.

25
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,390
What? You think it's a pity?

26
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,220
From what I think, I think your life is pitiful.

27
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,230
You should stop, too.

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,280
I know that I have no right to get between your business with one another,

29
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,170
but I really wish that both of you would stop it.

30
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:06,830
I'm not going to do any more.

31
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,980
If you say no to this, it's going to be the end.

32
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,850
Completely the end.

33
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,710
Do whatever you want. Play the piano or not.

34
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,810
But.

35
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,170
But, don't drag Seol into it while you are hesitating.

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,850
Does the world seem easy to you?

37
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,500
You should be the one to live properly.

38
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,850
Get lost, you jerk.

39
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:43,860
Let's go. Let's go, Seol.

<i>Episode 8</i>

41
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,360
You two fight every time you guys meet.

42
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,920
I feel like it's not because you two really hate each other, though.

43
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,860
Can't you be the bigger man?

44
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,460
I don't like you getting close to Baek In Ho.

45
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,910
I don't like how you're taking sides and how you're bothered by it.

46
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,160
Let's not talk about this anymore.

47
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:00,380
Tomorrow is my last day of school.

48
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
Huh?

49
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,370
That can't be.

50
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
But is there a rule saying that we are only allowed to meet at school?

51
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,040
We can just date outside of school.

52
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:20,440
Then, should we eat dinner together tomorrow?

53
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,890
Sure.

54
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
Head in.

55
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,950
- You should go first. <br> - We're already in front of your place. Go in.

56
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,810
I'm always the one to go first. Hurry and go.

57
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,180
Let's leave at the same time.

58
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,430
Go.

59
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:10,020
How can I be interested in playing piano now?

<i>Professor Hwang in International Business is looking for you regarding an internship</i>

61
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,410
Thank you. I used it well.

62
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,810
But why didn't you use your own?

63
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,930
Ah, I forgot mine at home.

64
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,670
- Min Soo. <br> - Huh?

65
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,560
Your style... changed.

66
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,070
Why? Is it strange?

67
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,940
No, it's great. It's pretty.

68
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,050
High five. Nice. I'm going.

69
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:02,640
- Thank you. <br> - It's nothing.

70
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:08,360
Does she think she's Hong Seol or what? This is ridiculous.

71
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,440
Wow!

72
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,330
Sunbae, hello!

73
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,580
- Did you ask me to come here? <br> - Me?

74
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:30,990
When did I? I was walking by and saw you come in, so I followed.

75
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,510
Now that I think about it, you're going for an internship next week, right?

76
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:41,260
I really wanted to tell you something. It's great that I have a chance to now.

77
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,710
What do you want to tell me?

78
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,070
Do you think life is fun these days?

79
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:50,230
You've already lived well. Now you have an internship and a girlfriend.

80
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,440
By the way you've been acting lately, I still find it surprising how you sent me to Hong Seol.

81
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,040
How can you be so thick-skinned about it?

82
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:06,110
Is this why everyone is like, "Yoo Jeong, Yoo Jeong"? Because they've all been tricked?

83
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,620
This. Did you send this to me?

84
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,360
Pardon?

85
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,460
When did I?

86
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,100
I don't know what you're trying to do.

87
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:25,960
You should stop it now. Aren't you playing around with Hong Seol for too long now?

88
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:31,120
Sunbae. You don't even like Hong Seol.

89
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,310
You're going to have a fling with her, then betray her like you did me, and make her take a leave from school, right?

90
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,850
What the heck do you keep talking about?

91
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,850
The messages you sent last year,

92
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,290
are all here as evidence. Are you going to still going to deny it?

93
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,640
"Seol must like you. Tell her that you like her."

94
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,570
"She likes presents. Spend a lot of money on them."

95
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:07,960
"It's vacation time, right? Visit her at her prep school."

96
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,300
I saved all of these.

97
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:19,320
How would Hong Seol feel after seeing these? Will she stay with you

98
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,670
after knowing that you had a guy stalk her?

99
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,480
Are you scared? You're scared. Scared.

100
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,180
You're scared.

101
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,060
But there's a big misunderstanding that I'm a stalker.

102
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,510
You're mistaken. I've never sent those messages.

103
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:44,600
Would anything change if you deny it? This is ridiculous.

104
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,730
I am dumbfounded because it is so sloppy. Pick it up. Hello?

105
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,990
<i>Hello?</i>

106
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,230
<i>Hey! Say something if you called, you SOB.</i>

107
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:02,120
It is mine...

108
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,910
So, what exactly did you just do?

109
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,930
This bastard! Just how long are going to play the hypocrite?

110
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,460
You are trash on the inside.

111
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,530
Hey! What are you doing right now? You said that you'd buy us meat, so we came here.

112
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,710
Did you go crazy after you told us that? You did this last year, too. Are you crazy?

113
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,640
- It's nothing, Sunbae. <br> - What happened?

114
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,100
You guys know already. Young Gun liked Seol before.

115
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,450
You're dating Da Yeong yet you're still hung up on Seol?

116
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,220
Sunbae, that's not it. Look here. These are the texts Yoo Jeong sent until now.

117
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,170
Let me see.

118
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,620
This isn't Jeong's number. This is the way you speak, too.

119
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,170
Sunbae, what are you talking about?

120
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,100
No, the numbers are different. The numbers in the middle are different.

121
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,900
- Yeah. <br> - Jeong, have you changed your number without me knowing?

122
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,550
I ought to...

123
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,770
What game are you playing now?

124
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,140
- You set this up, didn't you? <br> - Hey Oh Yeong Gon!

125
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,810
Look at this son of bi*ch!

126
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,480
- Oh, Da Young. This is a huge misunderstanding. <br> - A misunderstanding?

127
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,630
Wow, this kid is totally crazy.

128
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,560
- Wow, seriously. I must have been crazy. <br> - Noona, Noona.

129
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,690
- Why are you dating him? <br> - Hey, Oh Yeong Gon.

130
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,100
I'll never eat the meat you buy me from now on.

131
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,650
Gyeong Hwan, you buy it! Let's eat some pork belly today.

132
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,780
<i>Pork belly, okay?</i>

133
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,560
Isn't that pen recorder

134
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,530
a bit too pathetic?

135
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:37,250
You're so sloppy and thoughtless

136
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:40,160
that it's perplexing me.

137
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,900
<i>Sunbae, it's me, Yeong Gon.</i>

138
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,640
<i>The kids in my major are all ignoring me lately.</i>

139
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,900
<i>Thank you for giving me your number and forgiving me.</i>

140
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,980
<i>Is your relationship with everyone really bad?</i>

141
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,620
<i>From what I saw, Seol took good care of you last time.</i>

142
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:08,000
<i>Ah, you saw that?</i>

143
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,960
<i>Hong Seol was kind to me a bit.</i>

144
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,480
<i>It makes me think she likes me. What do you think?</i>

145
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,920
<i>Seol must like you.</i>

146
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,680
<i>Whom are you texting in front of me with a different phone?</i>

147
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,260
<i>Is it a girl? Who is she?</i>

148
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,010
<i>It's just a bothersome guy.</i>

149
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,060
<i>It was a guy? I thought it was girl.</i>

150
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:33,020
<i>Who is it? Who is this person bothering you?</i>

151
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,180
<i>Who is Oh Yeong Gon?</i>

152
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,340
<i>Who's Seol? What a loser.</i>

153
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,940
<i>Who is it? Which of the two is bothering you?</i>

154
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,870
<i>- Both of them. <br> - Both of them?</i>

155
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,050
<i>Wouldn't it be fine if you just stick this loser to Seol?</i>

156
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,090
<i>Should I take care of this for you? I'm extremely good at these things.</i>

157
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,970
<i>It's my specialty.</i>

158
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,990
<i>Try being honest and confessing to her.</i>

159
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,820
<i>It sounds good. It's just the way you'd speak.</i>

160
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:08,610
<i>I'm going to take this.</i>

161
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,270
<i>It seems like I won't be bored for a while.</i>

162
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,790
I contacted him with this number for a while, though.

163
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,610
But why did a woman pick up?

164
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,860
Yoo Jeong, this jerk.

165
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,700
He gave me a different number to make me look stupid.

166
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,400
Then what's up with this woman?

167
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:44,040
A second girl? A girlfriend?

168
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,530
He must be two-timing.

169
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,290
Yeong Gon, you're too smart.

170
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,160
Did you guys think I'd get tricked?

171
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,980
Sunbae!

172
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,190
It's nice here. There aren't many people.

173
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,510
I heard that Oh Yeong Gon did something strange today.

174
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,060
The kids are all talking about it. What's up with him?

175
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:39,250
- It's already hard on you. <br> - Seol.

176
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,050
Once I start my internship, you have to focus on school work.

177
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,390
Tell me if anything happens, okay?

178
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,840
- Why are you smiling? <br> - Just because. It feels good.

179
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:00,210
This is what it feels like when you have someone to worry about you.

180
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,810
Don't worry. I'll do well even without you.

181
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,240
Cheers.

182
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,500
Wow look who is here!

183
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,290
- Sit down, sit down. Gyeong Hwan, sit down. <br> - What are you two doing here?

184
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:20,530
- Since we're here, let's have a farewell party for Yoo Jeong. <br> - Hello.

185
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,300
He's an intern and he has a girlfriend.

186
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:26,170
- Ahjumma, three bottles of soju, please. <br> - Okay.

187
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:31,330
Let's start with a drink for Seol.

188
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,070
Seol doesn't drink much.

189
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,380
You are the man.

190
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:42,000
What? You're going to down it all? Wow.

191
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,450
Love's will, seriously...

192
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,200
Wait.

193
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't they need to do an initiation as a couple?

194
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,060
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

195
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,920
- Hurry, hurry, hurry. <br> - Kiss.

196
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,960
- I'll do it. <br> - Really?

197
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,510
- If you two do it, we'll do it too. <br> - Hey!

198
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,440
I don't want to. Never.

199
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,460
I really don't want to.

200
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,260
So stop it.

201
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,500
Male sunbaes teasing one female hoobae is too much, isn't it?

202
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,470
Okay, we should stop. Let's just drink.

203
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:23,570
I'm not drunk at all. I'm so good at drinking.

204
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,550
This is great.

205
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,680
Sunbae, are you okay?

206
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,500
Are you very drunk?

207
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,990
My head hurts.

208
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,020
It's so noisy.

209
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,270
Your head hurts... What do I do?

210
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,880
It's noisy. It's noisy.

211
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,970
It's noisy.

212
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,860
Sunbae, wait a second. Wait a second.

213
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,190
<i>He's drunk.</i>

214
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,220
Let's go outside for a bit. Let's leave.

215
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:12,200
Let's get out of here.

216
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,920
We're going to go outside for some air.

217
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,710
I'm not even drunk. Is he drunk?

218
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,300
Is it windy out? Aiyoo.

219
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,330
- You guys have to come back. <br> - You know that I liked her, right?

220
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:26,610
You know I liked her, right?

221
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,840
Sunbae, you're too drunk.

222
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,910
We're going to have to sit there. Let's sit here for a moment.

223
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,520
Careful, careful.

224
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,410
Sunbae.

225
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,200
Should we just ditch them?

226
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,340
I don't want to drink with them.

227
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,390
They think we're fools.

228
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,780
Oh, fools.

229
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,920
I had some people call me that in high school.

230
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,020
- They called you that? <br> - Yeah.

231
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:24,100
There are only people that want something from me besides me.

232
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,350
It was obvious,

233
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,580
but what could I have done? I just did what they wanted.

234
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,070
I'm more comfortable like that.

235
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,020
Seol, you really like me, right?

236
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,340
You're sincere, right?

237
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:09,500
At first, I thought you were like other people.

238
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,090
You really hated me.

239
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,250
Don't think of me as a bad person.

240
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,420
Sunbae.

241
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:43,920
It's fine. No one is watching.

242
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,350
How can I be interested in playing piano now?

243
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,180
Dog Fur!

244
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,290
Hello.

245
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:30,750
Look at her being hazy? Aren't you going into the shop?

246
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,780
It's too late...

247
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,360
Okay.

248
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,840
What did the person who gave you the business card say? Why did he give it to you?

249
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,760
Yeah.

250
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,980
She can't snap out of it. Why are you coming home alone? Where is Yoo Jeong?

251
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,550
Yeah?

252
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,020
Did you drink?

253
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,460
- Yeah?! <br> - The smell of alcohol is no joke. Just how much did you drink?

254
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:02,110
Where are you going? You said you are not going to the shop.

255
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,370
I am going home.

256
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:13,140
Has she gone mad? Did she leave her mind at the bar? Her drinking habit is too much.

257
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,960
I wonder if Sunbae got home alright.

258
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,530
<i>Did you get home alright?</i>

259
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,900
He must be really drunk.

260
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,290
Uhm, Seo. Good night.

261
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,360
You are asleep...?

262
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,960
How can you sleep?

263
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:36,810
Fine. I guess he can sleep because he has a lot of experience.

264
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,600
I can't sleep because I am not experienced...

265
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,360
Must be nice to have a lot of experience.

266
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,130
Noona, Noona. Let's have a chat.

267
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,290
Let go. I have nothing to say.

268
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,130
Noona, just a minute.

269
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:06,910
Noona that's a misunderstanding. I have no feeling for Hong Seol. Don't you trust me?

270
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,000
Would you trust you if you were me?

271
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,050
- Noona! <br> - <i>Hey Oh Yeong Gon!</i>

272
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:15,290
Did you apologize to Yoo Jeong?

273
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,120
He hasn't changed a bit.

274
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,480
I feel bad for Jeong.

275
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,590
How did he get hooked with a punk like him?

276
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:25,540
Enough already, acting pitiful to a girl.

277
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:28,480
- Your sunbae is talking... <br> - Yoo Jeong, Yoo Jeong, Yoo Jeong!

278
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,830
What so special about him that no one is listening to me?

279
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:38,480
Yoo Jeong! Yoo Jeong! Yoo Jeong!

280
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,150
I barely got the kids on my side...

281
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,200
Next we will talk about the halving principle and the issues surrounding it.

282
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,450
There are three, buried cost, opportunity cost, and trickle-up effect. Let's talk about the buried cost first.

283
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,790
May I sit here?

284
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,540
Are you still pouting?

285
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,460
You are so timid. I am sorry about the basketball incident last year.

286
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,910
Let's get over it, okay?

287
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,620
I can't hear the professor.

288
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,550
You are being too much among comrades.

289
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:32,160
We are comrades for liking Jang Bo Ra.

290
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,390
Right, Bo Ra is quite charming. She is petite but glamorous.

291
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:40,550
You don't know, right? I know though.

292
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:44,150
Of course you don't know. You can't possibly know.

293
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,940
Let's me show you something nice.

294
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:50,140
These are the pictures I took of her last year.

295
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,910
I can't share this carelessly because they are a bit racy.

296
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,650
What are you doing during the class?!

297
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:00,510
Stop it already!

298
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,790
Both of you get out right now!

299
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,810
Are you alright?

300
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:06,960
Ahh!

301
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,930
For me to pick this up, it is heaven's signal to get close with her.

302
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,600
I'll return this when we are eating later.

303
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,120
This is so cute, like Seol.

304
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,500
You are here early.

305
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:47,430
I am not Seol. I must look very similar with Seol for you to mistake me.

306
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,590
Seol! Hi.

307
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:57,670
You want to have lunch with me. I have something to tell you and to ask you about something.

308
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,860
Sit here.

309
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,700
Let's sit in the back.

310
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,390
If you did that in the military, you'd be in big trouble.

311
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:15,140
That's enough. I did wrong last year.

312
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,420
Right. You had fist fight during the basketball game last year.

313
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,840
Kids these days are really cute.

314
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,380
You hit Sunbae over a girl?

315
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,590
Apologize to Yeong Gon.

316
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:25,180
No, Sunbae—

317
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,150
Uh it hurts so much...

318
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:31,240
Hurry and apologize. Do you want us to make you do it?

319
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,750
I am sorry.

320
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:39,950
Do it properly. Not to us but properly to Yeong Gon with a 90 degree angle bow.

321
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:44,270
I am sorry.

322
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,840
I am okay.

323
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,430
Yeong Gon! Where are you?

324
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:52,440
Noona, I am here.

325
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,760
Yeong Gon!

326
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,750
Noona!

327
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,440
I heard what happened. Look at your face.

328
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:04,880
You really... Why are you so bad?

329
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,330
- Let's go. I'll put some medicine on you. <br> - Uhm let's go, Noona.

330
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:12,390
I don't have pictures like that, idiot.

331
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,720
Hey!

332
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,050
- Hey your temper---

333
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,280
Bring your business plan by next class.

334
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,750
Thank you.

335
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:27,610
This is no laughing matter anymore.

336
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:31,860
If Jang Bo Ra mistook her, then everybody is like that.

337
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,210
Don't you think we should have a word with her at this point?

338
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,870
What's the big deal about her wearing a similar style of clothes?

339
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:44,680
Look at her hair. It looks just like yours.

340
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:52,280
Seol! Let's have lunch together. I have something to tell you.

341
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,820
She is eating with me.

342
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:58,040
I am sorry.

343
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,750
- This... You— <br> - Hong!

344
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,430
Isn't this yours?

345
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,830
What is this? You took it?

346
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,330
Hey!

347
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,770
Is it not enough to copy Hong, so you are stealing her stuff now?!

348
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,580
Bo Ra, why to that extent...

349
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,860
Explain yourself.

350
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,740
Don't do it.

351
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,530
It's mine!

352
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,470
It's yours?

353
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:25,150
Uh. I bought it too, why?

354
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:29,710
Did you buy it yourself? If you found it somewhere—

355
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,050
No. I bought it because it was cute.

356
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:34,680
From where?

357
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,560
K-art at the front of the school.

358
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,150
You guys are really weird.

359
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,320
Hey!

360
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,800
What's with her? Why is she raising her voice?

361
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,950
She is lying about the whole thing.

362
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,790
He asked me to come see him, so isn't he inside?

363
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,630
Excuse me.

364
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,220
Yeah?

365
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,840
Where is Professor Sim Myeong Soo?

366
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,850
Not sure... Hi Professor!

367
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,730
Yeah, hi!

368
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,970
You came? Come on in.

369
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,210
It's coming. It's coming.

370
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:35,180
What to do what do to. I should've just returned it. Why did I...

371
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,240
That's not true. They're the ones who made me into a strange person first...

372
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,510
Who did I copy, really?

373
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,220
- I feel so wronged. <br> - Min Soo?

374
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,890
Oh it is you, Son Min Soo!

375
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,840
Oh Yeong Gon...

376
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,290
Hey is there something wrong?

377
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,870
How come your complexion looks that terrible? I can't touch it, can I.

378
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:59,690
You need to recharge your trigger. Drink.

379
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,200
Be strong.

380
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,500
I really was going to return it.

381
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,370
But the others suddenly cornered me.

382
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,730
I was so startled I misspoke.

383
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,230
I just really wanted to be friendly with Seol.

384
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:20,000
Things turned out this way so, what should I do?

385
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,960
Why do you want to become closer with Seol?

386
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,600
Seol's pretty even when she doesn't wear expensive things,

387
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,990
her grades are really great and she doesn't brag.

388
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:34,540
Her personality's so kind too.

389
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,530
No. I don't think so.

390
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,890
Why?

391
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,070
I mean you didn't do anything wrong, while she cornered you making you a thief.

392
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,070
How is that kind at all?

393
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,670
Is that right? In my opinion you're the much kinder person.

394
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:53,220
I mean you always get crushed by Seol yet you take her side.

395
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,750
- Really? <br> - Of course.

396
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:00,840
Also Hong Seol seems to be spreading rumors nowadays that you're copying her.

397
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,600
To me it looked like Hong Seol was copying you a bit.

398
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,960
- Oh yeah? <br> - It did!

399
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,180
Oh and doing well in your studies?

400
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,930
When you look at the way she leads, she orders everyone else around and doesn't do any work herself. Is that what a group leader's supposed to be?

401
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,400
In summary, there's nothing for which Hong Seoul is better than you.

402
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,730
Well besides the fact that she has a boyfriend.

403
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,180
She's trusting in her boyfriend too much and showing off. How long do you think that'll last?

404
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,370
One month? Two months?

405
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:36,830
Sunbae Yoo Jeong is such a complete fool for being deceived by her, you know?

406
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,000
It did seem a bit weird when she said she was dating.

407
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,820
Right? right? Wow, you're so sharp. Be confident Son Min Soo, okay?

408
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:50,170
If you're having any difficulties, tell me everything,okay? I'm completely available. Open-minded you know. You know, right?

409
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,430
- Yeah <br> - Now I'll get going. Work hard.

410
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,680
- Thank you. <br> - No problem.

411
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,990
Is she really nice or naive?

412
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:05,320
Well anyway it seems that Hong Seol's going to have some trouble because of her.

413
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:09,850
Yoo Jeong's probably too busy with his internship...

414
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,430
It's my world!

415
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,640
If I comfort her a bit by her side when she's having a hard time...

416
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,190
What to do... what to do... Yeong Gon please go out with me.

417
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,240
Oh yeah, I'll think about it. I'm so f-ing cool.

418
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,330
Oh Yeong Gon...

419
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,780
These are chocolates that I bought in Belgium.

420
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,880
- Wow! <br> - And this is herbal tea that I bought in the Netherlands.

421
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,310
I brought them because I thought of you.

422
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,630
Thank you so much. I'll eat them well.

423
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:45,750
How was your trip?

424
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,580
It was really great! I focused on the museums.

425
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:54,480
I felt so happy seeing them in real life after only having seen the artworks in photos.

426
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,750
How about you, Unni? How did you spend your break?

427
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,590
- I uh... <br> - Hoobae Hong

428
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,550
You took the labor-management relations theory class last year, right?

429
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:10,490
You know the notes you took? Could I please just borrow them?

430
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:14,620
But that's last year's class so... I'm not sure if I still have them.

431
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,540
But who is this person?

432
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,880
Introduce yourself. He's a senior from our major.

433
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,140
Hello. I'm Kang Ah Yeong.

434
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,360
Hello. Is this person, someone really close to you, Hoobae Hong?

435
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:33,360
- Yes. <br> - With you? Really?

436
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,440
- The notes are from last year are...<br> - Hello Ah Yeong.

437
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,690
I'm Kim Sang Cheol. I'm also the sunbae that Hoobae Hong trusts the most in the world.

438
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,680
It looks like our Ah Yeong is an art major.

439
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,350
Ah yes. I'm a freshman.

440
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:52,780
Wow, paintings!

441
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,030
Your major is just my type.

442
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:59,630
- Sunbae you only... have 5 minutes left till class. <br> - It's okay. But uh.

443
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,780
Did you have lunch? Do you want to carve steak?

444
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,710
We've got somewhere to go. We're busy, so. Ah Yeong let's go.

445
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,580
- Then uh... look. <br> - We're late.

446
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,660
Your contact info...

447
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,270
We're going to definitely see each other next time.

448
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,660
She's appeared. She's finally appeared.

449
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,310
You said that you've taken a break for awhile... And it shows.

450
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,990
- What are you talking... <br> - You don't have any basics down, yet you only focus on looking good.

451
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:44,820
You said you took a break for five years?

452
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,560
What did you do during that time?

453
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:56,300
I don't know why I'm sitting here listening to this.

454
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,160
What? It doesn't suit your taste?

455
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,500
You kept asking me to come, now I did and—

456
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:05,200
If you came at my request, now that I've seen you, go.

457
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,660
Professor.

458
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,030
- You've arrived? <br> - Welcome, Yeo Jin.

459
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,320
You don't have much time left until your recital. How do you feel?

460
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,920
I said I was ready, but I'm feeling a bit nervous. I can do well, right?

461
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,350
Of course you can.

462
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,290
Sit.

463
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,160
What are you doing there. Be on your way.

464
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,540
I am.

465
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,290
I'll see you tomorrow.

466
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,690
Don't be late tomorrow, okay?

467
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,130
Yes. Work hard.

468
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,970
<i>Sunbae, did you have a good first day at work?</i>

469
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:18,970
<i>- I'm working. You said that you were starting your part-time job at the library today didn't you?</i>

470
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,600
- It wasn't difficult? <br> - No. It was fine.

471
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:26,120
What's the point in saying it?

472
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,610
It's just like child's play.

473
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,180
Still it was the first thing that we got as a couple...

474
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,530
Mr. Baek In Ho.

475
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,100
What're you doing here?

476
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,850
Are you here to meet with the professor whose business card I gave you?

477
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,890
Did something happen?

478
00:37:07,910 --> 00:37:09,430
I don't know.

479
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,200
Wow...

480
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,720
You're really something.

481
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,990
How can you study on the subway?

482
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,710
What are you doing this for anyway?

483
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:32,370
I just hope to get a steady job. As long as I'm not unemployed.

484
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:35,300
Why are you worried. You're a college student.

485
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,140
That's what I had thought too.

486
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,240
When I was in high school, I thought that when I become a college student anything would be possible.

487
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,590
Now that I've come to college,

488
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:47,490
there have been some big obstacles.

489
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,940
I'm most envious of those people over there.

490
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,110
What's to be jealous about?

491
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,890
They just look like a bunch of corpses.

492
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:59,090
Have you never been jealous of anyone before?

493
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,920
I've never done that kind of thing.

494
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,910
That's probably so. Since you're talented.

495
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,370
I don't have any particular talent, so I work hard at everything I do.

496
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,100
Why do you work so hard? I mean... how do you work hard?

497
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,000
How do I work hard...

498
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:22,800
I just do. Just do it.

499
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,880
Then how come I don't?

500
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,240
I guess it's because you're a genius, then.

501
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,240
Yes, Sunbae.

502
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,960
Right now?

503
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,150
Sunbae.

504
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,310
What brings you here?

505
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,070
You've came together, both of you.

506
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,630
- He played piano at school today. <br> - Hey.

507
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,740
- Don't go around saying useless things. <br> - What do you mean? It's true.

508
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,410
It felt weird because we weren't with each other during the day.

509
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,060
What nonsense.

510
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:06,530
You must've... been so busy today because it was your first day at work.

511
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:08,870
I haven't come here yet after your store opened.

512
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,170
Can I have dinner here?

513
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,830
Of course.

514
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,820
But, my parents are around now.

515
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,820
Then I can formally introduce myself.

516
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,960
Pardon?

517
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,720
What?

518
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,900
Looking at you talking crap.

519
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,820
We have to clean. Leave.

520
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,480
Looks delicious!

521
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,830
Where are you going?

522
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:44,060
Right, so you and my daughter...

523
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,250
Yes, I'm her boyfriend.

524
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,420
My name is Yoo Jeong.

525
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,400
Mr. In Ho, turn off the water.

526
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,750
I received the wreath you sent last time very n— Mr. In Ho, please be quiet.

527
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,440
We wondered who that caring boyfriend was.

528
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,020
You're also so good looking.

529
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,170
You must be a senior.

530
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,020
Are you doing any extracurricular activities?

531
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:16,080
Yes, I'm doing an internship.

532
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,130
I suppose you can't count an internship as a job.

533
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,950
What do your parents do?

534
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:22,910
Dad,

535
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:25,290
That's a bit much to ask on the first meeting...

536
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,760
Yes. This seems like an interrogation.

537
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,450
Let go. Why?

538
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:35,470
Can't I even ask my daughter's boyfriend what his parents do for a living?

539
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,680
No. It's alright.

540
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,580
My father manages a company.

541
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,100
Company?

542
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,250
What company?

543
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,200
Taerang Group.

544
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,160
- Taerang Group? <br> - Taerang?

545
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,510
The Taerang Group we all know?

546
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:57,190
Mom.

547
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,900
Some water please.

548
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,910
You're thirsty, right?

549
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:04,610
In Ho, water please.

550
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,320
We're sorry.

551
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,000
It's okay.

552
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:31,200
Your father runs a big business, I see.

553
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,530
Your name is Jeong, right? You haven't eaten dinner yet?

554
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,880
Would noodle soup be alright?

555
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,200
Of course. I wanted to try since Seol has praised your dishes so much.

556
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:13,190
It's anchovy stock, but I'm not sure if you eat these kinds of things

557
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:15,110
Of course, I do. I''m wondering if I'm just causing you trouble.

558
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:16,910
No, not at all.

559
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,620
I'll eat thankfully and well.

560
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,910
Uh how long have you two been dating?

561
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,960
I think it's been two and a half months, approximately.

562
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,090
It's been a while.

563
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,600
What about?

564
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,880
Are you perhaps... the first son?

565
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,120
I'm an only child.

566
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,620
Then is that place your place of work?

567
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:48,900
Why are you being like this now?

568
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,370
- Mother, this tastes so good! <br> - Oh really? Try the kimchi too. It's from the batch I just made.

569
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,280
The kimchi is what tastes good.

570
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:01,660
- It's good. <br> - It's delicious, right?

571
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,900
Is it better than the one you get at home? Do the maids cook for you then?

572
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,230
Mom. Let's eat.

573
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,120
Oh, I'm sorry.

574
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,860
Oh you eat so well. The stock.

575
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,580
It's really delicious, Mother.

576
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,730
Try eating it for ten years, see if it tastes good.

577
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:25,630
I've eaten well. Thank you.

578
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,550
You could have some fruit before you go.

579
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,930
It's late.

580
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:33,040
You're in such a hurry. It would've been nice to have tea and go.

581
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:35,640
We have tea at home?!

582
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,580
Honey... you...

583
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,590
Then, go on in.

584
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,600
Okay, have a nice date!

585
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,610
No, I'm just going to drop him at the car.

586
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,530
Don't be late!

587
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,570
Okay.

588
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:49,000
See you later.

589
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,250
Bye.

590
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,840
He's really super awesome.

591
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:59,170
If those two were to get married, wouldn't we have hit the jackpot?

592
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,600
That doesn't even make sense.

593
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,200
We're different on many levels.

594
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,450
Where did In Ho go?

595
00:44:17,450 --> 00:44:18,790
Oh, In Ho.

596
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,770
Where did you go?

597
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:22,280
To smoke.

598
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,910
What is wrong with you? What's the problem? Why are you pissed off?

599
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:36,770
He is friendly, handsome and eats well.

600
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:40,080
And why did you turn on the TV there?

601
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,750
I ought to...

602
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,600
Be quiet and give me a cup of tea since you said you have some at home.

603
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:48,810
If they got married, we'd bow to Seol's boyfriend.

604
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:51,660
Ayo... Seriously..

605
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,980
<i>It's been five years, you said?</i>

606
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:02,010
<i>What have you been doing all those years?</i> <br> -What was I doing all these years?

607
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,330
You were put in a difficult situation because of my dad's questions, right?

608
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,090
It's okay. It's not like it's a proper secret.

609
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,240
That's a relief.

610
00:45:20,910 --> 00:45:23,650
I liked your family.

611
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:28,000
Thank you for accepting them.

612
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,940
Sunbae, did you get home alright last night? You were really drunk.

613
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:41,360
Sure. I got home and slept well too.

614
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,340
The job went well too.

615
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:46,040
<i>Did he by chance</i>

616
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,650
<i>drink and forget everything?</i>

617
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:50,630
Seol.

618
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:51,880
Yes?

619
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,990
Did Baek In Ho say he'd continue to come to school?

620
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,960
Baek In Ho...

621
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,280
Well, I'm not sure.

622
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,310
<i>It was our first kiss.</i>

623
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:10,520
<i>Did he really forget?</i>

624
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,060
<i>He must have blacked out.</i>

625
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,810
What are you thinking?

626
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:20,160
Nothing.

627
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,210
Then. Goodbye.

628
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:32,560
I didn't forget.

629
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,230
I remember.

630
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,910
Head home safely.

631
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:57,930
<i>♫ Please call my name again ♫</i>

632
00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,860
<i>♫ If you want to know my secrets them call me out again ♫</i>

633
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:07,150
<i>♫ Please hold my hand ♫</i>

634
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:12,000
<i>♫ Please let your long hidden heart be found out ♫</i>

635
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,000
<i>♫ What to do with you, me and us? ♫</i>

636
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,210
<i>- He is my college alumnus. <br> - He seems to know his stuff.</i>

637
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,850
Yes, yes, yes.

638
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,400
Oh! Bye then.

639
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,790
Baek In Ho, you've come again.

640
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,210
Felt sorry, I guess?

641
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:39,780
I came to learn.

642
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:43,090
Okay. Come in then.

643
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:58,160
This is Hanon...Hanon.

644
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:03,320
I've played piano many years. It not like you are training a mutt or anything...

645
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,980
Don't want to?

646
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,510
I'll do it.

647
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,590
Keep playing until I return from class.

648
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,060
When does your class end?

649
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,990
Professor.

650
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,900
Ah, this.

651
00:48:21,410 --> 00:48:23,710
How is he a professor...?

652
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,020
But why do I have to play this one?

653
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:30,700
Ah, seriously... This hurts my pride...

654
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,610
Let's just try it first.

655
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:48,220
Ah! It's not like I'm playing around...

656
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,880
Just because I didn't play the piano for five years.

657
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:55,490
Let's try it. Let's try it first.

658
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,860
Ah.. Really.

659
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,370
Do I really do this?

660
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,570
<i>Baek In Ho came to look for me.</i>

661
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,720
<i>I don't think he's even touched a piano.</i>

662
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,980
<i>Right. He is stiffened up a lot, hasn't he?</i>

663
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,990
<i>He was always stubborn.</i>

664
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,410
<i>I request one thing.</i>

665
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:04,280
<i>Please let him know that for him patience is a real talent.</i>

666
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,140
Oh this is killing me.

667
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:30,070
<i>You'd be in trouble if you were in the military.</i>

668
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:32,490
- Hey! <br> - What are they doing?

669
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,240
Hey Jang Bo Ra!

670
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,200
- You need to handle Kwan Eun Tak better. <br> - What are you talking about?

671
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:43,910
Don't you know that he beat Yeong Geon because of you?

672
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:46,530
Does he only know how to fight...?

673
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,000
Then be responsible and date him or something.

674
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,140
You must think you're too pretty, but

675
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,040
don't lead everyone on and just pick one.

676
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:01,040
What did you say?!

677
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,920
Dating Oh Yeong Gon? Are they mad together?

678
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,700
So when I checked, Eun Tak was passing out coffee to sunbaes and bowing

679
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:16,650
as if he'd done something wrong. And when I asked him,

680
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,370
he wouldn't answer and told me not to worry.

681
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:23,750
I'm pretty sure Oh Yeong Gon did something to him first.

682
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:28,910
Just what does his DNA look like? Everything he does is weird.

683
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:31,630
I need to get him good one of these days.

684
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,360
Here comes imitation.

685
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,320
Son Min Soo!

686
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:40,480
Are you cosplaying again today?

687
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,790
What are you saying, cosplaying?

688
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:47,550
Seol, aren't you the one following me?

689
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:48,650
Huh?

690
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:50,100
Never mind.

691
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:52,900
That person really... Hey!

692
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,900
Did she eat something wrong?

693
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:58,700
Ahew that and Oh Yeong Gon are pissing me off together.

694
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,220
I hate them. Seol, why aren't you doing anything?

695
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,250
She is treating you like nothing because you are not saying anything.

696
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,220
You talk about the doll later for sure, huh?

697
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:12,050
Talk about it, please!

698
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:20,420
Sunbae is here.

699
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,980
Sunbae.

700
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,470
I saw all the material you sent me yesterday.

701
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,710
Bo Ra.

702
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,200
I think your video is too long. Shorten it a bit please.

703
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,590
Got it.

704
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:39,400
<i>She is rough draft type. I predict she nags a lot.</i>

705
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,140
And Gyeong Hwan.

706
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:45,590
You are supposed to explain about terms in leading the contracts. I think it's a bit lacking.

707
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:47,060
Please do some additional work.

708
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:49,220
<i>Optimist with no plan.</i>

709
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:52,080
<i>How to control him is the key.</i>

710
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:55,800
Sunbae Sang Cheol.

711
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,130
...omit the one below.

712
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:02,320
When will you send me the CEO cases? It was due yesterday.

713
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,040
Haven't you sent it yet?

714
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,990
<i>Sunbae Sang Cheol: Please give me Ah Yeong's number.</i>

715
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:17,500
Sorry. Sorry. It's because there was such an important occurrence at our house last night.

716
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,890
Aww... Hyung, you're really too much.

717
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,870
You had the smallest part, and yet still you didn't do it?

718
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,830
I said I was sorry. With the exams, and the stuff at home

719
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,710
all coming down on me at once, I didn't have time.

720
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:32,180
Speaking of which... about finding the compensation,

721
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,640
couldn't Hoobae Hong help out?

722
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,610
- Hong again? <br> <i> - It's not deja vu again.</i>

723
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,300
<i>Do I look like a pushover?</i>

724
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:43,210
If you get a free ride again,

725
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,470
I'm going to leave your name out. <br> - What?

726
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,560
Didn't you hear what Professor Kang said last time?

727
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,170
Any team member who is getting a free ride,

728
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:54,700
she said I can leave names out, so I'm going to do that.

729
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,050
Ah, I really can't believe this.

730
00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,420
Hey, it's not like I'm not doing it on purpose!

731
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:03,090
Can't you understand that I had something going on at home?

732
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,510
Are you really going to treat me this way?

733
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:08,570
- That's enough. You were wrong last semester! <br> - Why raise your voice?

734
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,800
Sunbae, don't you remember how she got a D last time because of you?

735
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:15,150
I won't tolerate it if we get a D again because of you!

736
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,080
Why you little...

737
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,000
And you, Seol.

738
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,370
You can't threaten me saying you'll exclude my name.

739
00:54:22,410 --> 00:54:26,060
- Send the CEO cases by today. <br> - Fine!

740
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,310
What time will you send it by?

741
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,200
<i>He's right,. Everyone is being deceived by Seol.</i>

742
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,670
<i>If they get to know her, she's isn't nice at all.</i>

743
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,550
<i>Look at her nagging at the other kids.</i>

744
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:39,740
- You must take care of that. <br> - I got it!

745
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:43,160
Anyway, I collected the materials.

746
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,960
Hey Min So, I received what you sent me.

747
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,040
Really?

748
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,320
You've done a lot of research.

749
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:54,690
There were things that weren't relevant.

750
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,320
I reorganized the good materials and sent it back to you. Did you check?

751
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:02,300
- Oh... Not yet. <br> - Check that out today.

752
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,220
I sent links that are helpful too.

753
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,820
If you don't understand anything, call me any time.

754
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:12,620
Okay. I'll work really hard, Sunbae.

755
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:20,190
Hey, fake Seol! Let's have a chat.

756
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,950
Why? What chat?

757
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,360
That's enough.

758
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,890
Don't just take it in and talk out the things that need to be talked about.

759
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,430
Min Soo... Should we go somewhere and have a chat?

760
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,800
No! I'm okay here.

761
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,250
- I want to talk here. <br> - Okay then.

762
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:45,640
That doll. Are you sure that's yours?

763
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:49,990
- The K-Art store that you mentioned, they said they don't have that. <br> - What?

764
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:51,660
When I saw it last time,

765
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,110
it looked really similar, that is why.

766
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,270
Can you show it to me for a bit?

767
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:59,210
You really didn't pick it up?

768
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,960
<i>If Hong Seol ever does that again, scream at her.</i>

769
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,530
<i>Hong Seol hates to get attention.</i>

770
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:08,820
<i>Besides, the person with the louder voice will win.</i>

771
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:12,580
I didn't! You're really funny, Seol.

772
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,000
I heard that I'm trying to copy you.

773
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,860
Now you're calling me thief?

774
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:18,940
Perhaps you have victim mentality.

775
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,720
Why would I copy you? And also, that doll.

776
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,870
I definitely bought it from that store, okay? <br> - Hey! What did you say?

777
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,730
You're really shameless.

778
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:30,170
Come and follow us. Let's go to K-Art and ask together.

779
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,920
- I would I go? <br> - Hey, stop already!

780
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:34,670
I've been watching for a while.

781
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:37,290
Without any proof, don't needlessly drag her down.

782
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,730
Don't you think it's too much between classmates?

783
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,040
Hey, Min Soo. You be the bigger person.

784
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,400
Hey! Where are you going? Hey!

785
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,600
Let's stop it. Let's go.

786
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,470
You are going to let her have it?!

787
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,790
Wow, how can we attend school being so frightened.

788
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:56,490
- You're scary. <br> - Ah... Seriously.

789
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,540
From now, if Bo Ra and Seol do that to you again, let us know.

790
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,530
Thank you, Unni.

791
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:06,210
That's right, you seemed cool earlier, screaming at Seol like that.

792
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,070
You look a little different.

793
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:10,350
Hey... You're thousand times better than Seol.

794
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,680
Yes, you are. I'm leaving then.

795
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,120
- Bye. <br> - Goodbye.

796
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,640
What are you doing, seriously?

797
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,180
Hey you! You're mine, so I gave a kiss.

798
00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:22,860
Come here! Oh, it won't do. Let's go!

799
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:26,960
Why won't it do? Why not?

800
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,230
That's right, I can do it too.

801
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,180
Oh Yeong Gun is right.

802
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,870
Seol isn't better than me.

803
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,400
She couldn't say anything to me earlier...

804
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:09,270
- Excuse me! <br> - What to do? I think I stared at him too much.

805
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:12,940
- Hey, you're a student here right? <br> - Yes.

806
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,160
- Where is the music department? <br> - Music department?

807
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:19,380
I came to meet a friend, but I can't find where to go.

808
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,370
I'll show you the map of the school.

809
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,710
Here... if you look here.

810
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:39,650
Right now, we're here.

811
00:58:39,650 --> 00:58:41,960
If you go this way and up.

812
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,090
Turn left and go to number eight.

813
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,070
Ah... So it was here.

814
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:50,540
Thank you.

815
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:13,930
<i>The number you're trying to call...</i>

816
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,240
<i>I am in the middle of company dinner. Sorry.</i>

817
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:24,420
That's right. Sunbae must be busy.

818
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,960
I should do my work too.

819
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,610
Oh! My pretty niece.

820
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:47,360
- Uncle. <br> - You're a little late today.

821
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,240
The school is hard? Look at your face.

822
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:55,380
Pour me a full cup of coffee.

823
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:57,450
I must study for exams.

824
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:00,720
Caffeine is not good for your body.

825
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,560
- Ah! <br> - I got you.

826
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,880
I'll draw out all the caffeine with the power of love.

827
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,080
Also, Baek In Ho is here.

828
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,700
I didn't throw out the piano like you asked.

829
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,090
He comes to clean the place and to play piano after work.

830
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,850
He only plays a few notes every day. He must be a beginner.

831
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:25,710
Is that so?

832
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,170
- Must be noisy. <br> - A bit.

833
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,050
What are you? When did you get here?

834
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,860
Make some noise when walking!

835
01:00:54,890 --> 01:00:57,170
What's the big fuss?

836
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,920
I came here because uncle said you're here playing piano.

837
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,100
Weren't you good at playing piano?

838
01:01:03,130 --> 01:01:06,100
This... I played this when I was in elementary school.

839
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:10,890
It's all because of you. I'm doing this because you gave me the card.

840
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:14,550
So you went to see the professor, huh?

841
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:19,380
- He told you to play this? <br> - Yes.

842
01:01:19,950 --> 01:01:23,650
But this Hanon has a deeper meaning.

843
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:31,920
What's the point of talking about it when you know nothing about art?

844
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:38,380
Then do you know how to write Art in Chinese?

845
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,470
This...

846
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:45,190
You only know how to play Czerny.

847
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,870
And you are just playing Hanon now.

848
01:01:49,870 --> 01:01:53,220
It was a lie when you said you played the piano well, right?

849
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,610
I play it really well.

850
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:24,420
You really do. Your hand can reach from there to here.

851
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:26,780
What? Say that again.

852
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,470
No, I've never seen

853
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,050
up this close before.

854
01:02:32,050 --> 01:02:34,510
- Do you want to learn? <br> - Really? <br> - Yes!

855
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:37,370
I can't live after you dissed me.

856
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:41,420
Tell me if you have any requests. Do you even know any music?

857
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,920
- You can only play Czerny. <br> - Not true.

858
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,430
<i>Was he like this when he was in high school?</i>

859
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:34,170
<i>It feels really nice.</i>

860
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:48,730
I don't know! I don't know.

861
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,910
The later part...

862
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:39,800
I play this the best.

863
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:41,930
This is the only one, right?

864
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:46,450
<i>Even if the small things come like ripples,</i>

865
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:49,070
<i>they are still just ripples.</i>

866
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:51,530
<i>Just as everyone else does,</i>

867
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:54,140
<i>I can endure it.</i>

868
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:57,790
Anything other than this?

869
01:05:14,090 --> 01:05:19,040
<i>♫ For still not being able to say ♫</i>

870
01:05:20,550 --> 01:05:25,110
<i>♫ When I see you, I ♫</i>

871
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:29,340
<i>♫ As though nothing had happened ♫</i>

872
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:34,660
<i>♫ As though I have no interest, like that ♫</i>

873
01:05:34,660 --> 01:05:37,220
<i>That loser bastard, just let me see him.</i>

874
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:40,620
<i>Let's just commute with me. I think that'll be the best.</i>

875
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:44,940
<i>Take me in for a while. I got kicked out of my place suddenly, thanks to someone.</i>

876
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:48,140
<i>- So? <br> - Hong Seol called today.</i>

877
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:51,890
<i>Just understand that I am doing my best to keep my cool about the thing you did today.</i>

878
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:55,670
<i>How did we end up like this? We were so close back then.</i>

879
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:59,740
<i>Seol, I came to apologize.</i>

880
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,540
<i>It's not just the reports, though.</i>

881
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:06,230
<i>Was it really you who sent him those texts about me liking Oh Yeong Gon?</i>

882
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,230
<i>Yes, it was me.</i>

883
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:10,770
<i>I want to be close to you, But I can't.</i>

884
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:15,020
<i>I liked you because you were really like me.</i>

885
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:18,110
<i>- We are different. <br> - What about you, Sunbae?</i>

886
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:20,920
<i>What kind of person are you?</i>
