00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,650

I'm sorry.

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:12,370
Huh? Wait, you aren't...

16
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,570
But your name isn't on the attendance list.

17
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,310
I switched. I thought this class would be more interesting, you see.

18
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,450
Oh, is that right? Nice to meet you.

19
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,890
As expected, smart people take my classes.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:29,170

23
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,330
<i>What's with this person?!</i>

24
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,170
<i>What is he trying to do?</i>

25
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,890
We'll stop the class here.

26
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,990
There will be weekly quizzes until the mid-term and the group presentation will replace the final.

Submit a ten-page report on strategic management by next week.

Hey, what's with all these complaints?

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,750
Try to think about your tuition. How much do you pay?

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,430
It's ten times more than what I paid.

31
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,170
It is an enormous sum, but isn't that money a waste.

32
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,110
If you measure the worth of this class in money, it must be a billion won.

33
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:18,330
I have studied and worked hard, as if it was a religion,

34
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:22,130
to lay out everything for you in this course.

35
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,330
You just sit down and take everything in. Do you understand?

36
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,690
Yes.

37
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,050
Now, I'll end it here.

38
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,890
You worked hard.

Seol, do you want to eat lunch together?

42
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,370
No. I have an appointment.

43
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,970
What is this? Why is he following me?

44
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,490
It's because he has long legs, right?

45
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,830
Sunbae, exactly what...?

46
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,930
<i>The suspicious senior has started behaving suspiciously.</i>

47
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,030
- Hello.<br>- Hi.

48
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,790
<i>Throughout the semester he has been chasing after me for unknown reasons.</i>

49
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,830
<i>A person whose greetings I even want to ignore, suddenly acts friendly while smiling.</i>

50
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,590
<i>When it is time to eat he appears like a ghost.</i>

51
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,850
Have you had lunch?

52
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,850
Yes, of course. It is late.

53
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,470
It's only half past eleven, though. And you already ate?

54
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,910
I just ate because I was hungry.

55
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,330
Aigoo, I'm full.

56
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,720
So full...

57
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,610
<i>No matter how hard I try to avoid him,</i>

58
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,650
<i>he is definitely doing this on purpose.</i>

59
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,130
- It seems as if that was a hard bump, let me see...<br>- I'm fine.

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,030
- Are you really okay?<br>- I'm telling you I'm fine!

61
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,450
<i>But now I can't anymore...</i>

62
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,490
Sunbae, talk with me for a second.

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,450
I apologize.

64
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:39,470
I told you back then too, but I'm really sorry about the thing with the class registration.

65
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:44,830
I... I misunderstood early and caused trouble for you.

66
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,170
Please forgive me.

67
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,050
This won't do.

68
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,030
Why?

69
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,190
But I'm giving you a warm and sincere apology like this...

70
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:01,610
In an apology, shouldn't the receiving person usually be satisfied with it?

71
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,390
Of course.

72
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,850
What can I do to satisfy you?

73
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,130
Eat with me.

74
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,530
<i>Is this person obsessed with eating?</i>

75
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,270
Since it's five now, we can eat dinner. You don't have to work part-time today either.

76
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,110
<i>How does he know even my schedule?</i>

77
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,250
It can't be that you won't eat with me even to apologize, right?

78
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,430
<i>Okay, if it's eating, I'll eat.</i> <br> Of course not.

79
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,510
<i>If that is his wish, let's eat once.</i>

80
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,490
Should we go?

81
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,290
It's that way though.

82
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:46,270
Thank you, I'll eat it well.

83
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,650
I wanted to buy something more delicious.

84
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,670
Oh, no. This is more than enough.

85
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,510
I have never eaten anything at a convenience store before.

86
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,210
Have this.

87
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,990
Thanks.

88
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,290
<i>Get yourself together, Hong Seol. You can't be fooled by that smile.</i>

89
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,570
<i>And that human is as sly as a snake.</i>

90
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:23,150
Hey, I'm sorry.

91
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,830
<i>And sly...</i><br>Yes?

92
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:31,270
Recently, I have insisted too often that you eat, right?

93
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,410
You see, I wanted to talk with you once.

94
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,830
Truthfully, I fully understand that you misunderstood the class registration incident.

95
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,990
<i>Get yourself together. This human is as sly as a snake.</i>

96
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,750
- Sorry. <br>- No.

97
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,390
<i>He is sly... Is he sly? Maybe not?</i>

98
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,330
I was wrong to misunderstand you in that incident,

99
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,290
and truthfully I should pay for all this...

100
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,650
Right? It's like that.

101
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,390
So don't feel sorry anymore, and treat me for dinner next time.

102
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,710
Huh?

103
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,250
Let's eat something better than this then.

104
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:11,510
Yes. I'll buy it.

105
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,530
<i>I knew he is a human as sly as a snake!</i>

106
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,010
Which way are you going?

107
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,010
What about you, Sunbae?

108
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,150
I'm going to the library.

109
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,630
Oh, I have to go to the business administration building.

110
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,930
Thank you for the meal.

111
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,050
Oh? Unnie?

112
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,430
- Ah Yeong!<br>- Unnie!

113
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,570
How long has it been?

114
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,850
Even so, I was going to contact you.

115
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,250
How's school? Is it bearable?

116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,770
Yes, I like it so much. I like it even more because you attend.

117
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:56,410
Aigoo, even your words are so pretty.

118
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,250
But, that person...

119
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,930
Ah... Greet him, he's our sunbae.

120
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,470
Oh, hello. I'm Kang Ah Yeong.

121
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,850
I'm Seol's close friend.

122
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,450
- Right, nice to meet you.<br>- Wow, awesome...

123
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,010
You're very handsome.

124
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,290
Thanks.

125
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,330
I'm also a little bit thankful.

126
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,550
Sunbae. We'll get going now.

127
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,310
Goodbye! See you next time...

128
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,650
Unni, are you close with that sunbae?

129
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,670
I'm not close with him. Not at all.

130
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,410
What is his name?

131
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:44,090
Kang Ah Yeong, the thing you have to be the most careful about in college is guys. Okay?

132
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,950
Even though the outside is fine, it doesn't mean that the inside is too.

133
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,230
You can't know exactly what's on their minds, and there are snake-like guys too.

134
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,990
Is the senior from earlier like that?

135
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,590
No... He isn't definitely like that.

136
00:08:56,590 --> 00:09:01,330
I would just like it if my angel-like Ah Yeong would choose a guy cautiously.

137
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,730
How do you pick a guy?

138
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,430
So this is Yeonhee University Yoo Jeong bastard is attending...

139
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,250
What is that punk doing?

140
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,690
What bastard's school is this f*ing big?

141
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,690
What? Are you a university student?

142
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,470
Where is the business administration building?

143
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,490
Follow me.

144
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,250
Follow you?

145
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,490
What are you? A professor? Student?

146
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,090
Seol!

147
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,390
Seol, do you want to eat?

148
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:54,950
Do you want to eat? Seol!

149
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,110
Seol!

150
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,430
It's too much even dreaming about it...

151
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,790
It will be perfect if I print it out now.

152
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,470
Oh my!

153
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,070
Hey! Come over here.

154
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,790
This girl.

155
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,390
Are you ignoring me?

156
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,840
- Me?<br>- Yeah, you.

157
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,440
Where's the business department?

158
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,050
I don't know.

159
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:57,240
What do you mean you don't know? You're a student at this school.

160
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,260
Just share with that Ahjusshi over there.

161
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,280
I'm busy, so goodbye.

162
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,570
What do you take me for?

163
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,660
Hey, you there!

164
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,990
- Hey...<br> - Hey!

165
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,560
- Hey, let's go.<br> - Stop right there!

166
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,390
- What? Ahju-- <br> - Hey, quick, pull my stroller! Come here!

167
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,360
- Dammit!<br>- You're not going to stop?!

168
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,270
Hey, stop right there!

169
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,250
Hey, stop!

170
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,540
Hey! Stop! Hey!

171
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,100
Where did you go?

172
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,580
Where did you go?

173
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,410
He's gone. He left.

174
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:58,430
What's with this ajusshi, seriously? You stink.

175
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,530
Drink some water. You worked hard, you worked hard.

176
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,440
They're going to think I'm a bum.

177
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,840
Do you have money?

178
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,010
- What?<br>- Do you have money?

179
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,850
I don't have any. What are you saying?

180
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,630
Give me 1,000₩ ($1).

181
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,410
- Here. Leave quickly. <br> - Wait, what's that?

182
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,900
- Why? <br>- It will be fine if you just give me this cabbage (green bill, 10,000₩).

183
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,030
What nonsense is this? What is this?

184
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:34,010
- I'm going to call Mr. Kim. MR. KIM! <br> - I get it, I get it.

185
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,180
This ajusshi, seriously.

186
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,250
Give me 1000₩ more.

187
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,430
Go then, hurry.

188
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,420
- I'm seriously going crazy.<br> - I'm taking it.

189
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,650
- Go, hurry, hurry.<br> - Thanks.

190
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,040
Ah, hurry up and go! Hurry.

191
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,930
Then, stroller, come with me.

192
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,560
- See you later.<br> - Yes.

193
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,990
That girl thought I was a bum... Where did she go?

194
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:14,560
I couldn't even charge because of that person.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,290
What the heck? Why is it like this?

196
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:25,350
I only had it on my hard disk.

197
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,690
I have to retype everything again.

198
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,710
Hey, by any chance, do you have your laptop?

199
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,310
I didn't bring my laptop today. Sorry.

200
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,050
Excuse me, Unni, by any chance, can I borrow your laptop for a sec?

201
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,520
Ah, I also need to write with it. Sorry.

202
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,950
No.

203
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,160
You want to use this?

204
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,260
What? T-Thank you.

205
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:10,730
- Hello. <br> - Hello.

206
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,320
On this bright spring day and right after lunch, aren't your eyelids very heavy?

207
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,050
Now, keep your eyes open. Today's class will be very important.

208
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:23,580
In strategic management, there is directional strategy

209
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:28,080
and there's also portfolio strategy.

210
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,140
This is always something I want to emphasize.

211
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,990
What is strategy?

212
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,240
What is it?

213
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,380
Ah, I'm really speechless.

214
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,550
If the teacher talks,

215
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:46,670
is it enough to write it down and just memorize it without thought?

216
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,430
Is that how you'll remember it? It doesn't make sense.

217
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,360
Eh? When I'm telling you this,

218
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,290
you should be looking at me right now.

219
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,950
You there. You there!

220
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,640
Excuse me, Professor. Can I ask you a question?

221
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,010
Oh, sure, Yoo Jeong, go ahead.

222
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:07,230
I heard about the five levels of strategies called "Five Boxes" before.

223
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,950
It seems that it was left out of our textbook.

224
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,330
Is it not important to what we are learning?

225
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,550
Hey, I'm surprised.

226
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:18,350
You've already read through the textbook once, Yoo Jeong.

227
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,840
Our textbooks aren't always perfect.

228
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:24,180
That's why I am giving this lecture today to make up for it.

229
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,110
Should we take a look at it?

230
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,940
Now, the five boxes!

231
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:39,290
I've told you that the report was due for today last time, didn't I? Someone collect them for me.

232
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,940
- I'll pick them up. <br> - Sure, Yoo Jeong.

233
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,230
It's now 4:40 right now, so you have until 5 to bring them to my office.

234
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,810
- Yes.<br> - Okay.

235
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,420
Then, class is over.

236
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:53,440
You've worked hard.

237
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,340
Are you almost done?

238
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,450
Yes, yes. Just one moment.

239
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,760
Do you have to watch me like that?

240
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,120
Why? Am I bothering you?

241
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,400
Yes.

242
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,150
That's a relief.

243
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,790
What?

244
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:40,030
You bother me a lot too.

245
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,060
What does that mean?

246
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,780
The time...

247
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:51,680
<i>♫ Were you watching me in secret? ♫</i>

248
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,490
<i>♫ Call my name again ♫</i>

249
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,730
<i>♫ Call me again if you want to know about the secret ♫</i>

250
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,490
- Sunbae, I...<br> - What?

251
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,450
<i> Nothing is working. Why out of all times when he is here? </i>

252
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:18,200
<i>♫ You, I, and us. What do we do? ♫</i>

253
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,300
<i>♫ Please hold my hand ♫</i>

254
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,930
<i>♫ Please let your long hidden heart be discovered ♫</i>

255
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:35,840
<i>♫ You, I, and us. What do we do? ♫</i>

256
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,220
<i>♫ I am not just saying that ♫</i>

257
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:45,700
<i>♫ You, I, and us. What do we do? ♫</i>

258
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,530
<i>♫ My heart flutters now, too♫</i>

259
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,170
It came out really well.

260
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,120
Sunbae, hello.

261
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,810
Oh, Joo Yeon.

262
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,250
I'll take this now.

263
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,700
No, it's okay. I'm the one collecting them today.

264
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,510
Thank you so much. If it weren't for Sunbaenim today--

265
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:13,890
It's not that much. Oh, you couldn't take notes today, right?

266
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:18,210
Here. Take your time looking and give it back later.

267
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,290
Yes.

268
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,260
- I'm leaving now. Work hard. <br> - Yes.

269
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,830
Thank you.

270
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,250
I didn't know you had that kind of talent.

271
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:35,280
Pretending you don't care from the front, and flirting with him from the back.

272
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,340
Nam Joo Yeon, I think you're misunderstanding something.

273
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,360
Don't be so happy that Sunbae is showing interest in you

274
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,800
because Sunbae is friendly to anyone.

275
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,920
Why did I come here?

276
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,950
I seriously...

277
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,930
- What, what?<br> - In Ho, it's me.

278
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:13,550
The president is really mad. What are you going to do?

279
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,890
What can I do? I told him that I was quitting.

280
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,750
Hey, don't I have the freedom to pick where I live and where I work?

281
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,590
It's in the Constitution.

282
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,690
In Ho, you're surprisingly smart for someone who got kicked out of high school.

283
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,180
Hey, what do you mean <i>kicked out</i>? I walked out of there by myself.

284
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:33,640
Anyway, the president is going to be so mad when he catches you, so hide well.

285
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,910
Why would he catch me? Does he have something...

286
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,870
If he asks for me. Tell him I went to Busan or that I went overseas.

287
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,850
- Would he believe that? <br> - I don't care!

288
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,720
Hel... In Ho?

289
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,530
Baek In Ho?

290
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,270
- No, it wasn't.<br> - Where is he?

291
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:00,070
He... He went overseas.

292
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:03,160
You made an international call right now?

293
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,920
Aigoo, Sang Geun.

294
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:12,090
He went to Seoul, or maybe he didn't.

295
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,310
You almost fooled me, you punk.

296
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,250
I...

297
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,980
I have to hide again.

298
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,030
What lucky lives you lead.

299
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,100
Two-hundred fifty dollars is too expensive...

300
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:48,570
Is that your dog's name? Or your mom's?

301
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,900
I can leave the reports I collected for Professor Gang here, right?

302
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,850
Yeah, put them there.

303
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:05,970
You are going to apply for early graduation this semester, right?

304
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,950
No.

305
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:12,110
Why not? Weren't you going to study abroad?

306
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,090
<i>Isn't it better to graduate quickly?</i>

307
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:15,990
You are interested a lot in other people's business.

308
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,520
You have enough credits, so why won't you graduate?

309
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,250
Don't concern yourself about it. I am going to finish out the rest of the semester.

310
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,990
I am having the most fun now, out of all my time in school.

311
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:46,730
Report / Professor: Kang Seo Yeon / Student Name: Hong Seol

312
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:00,640
Why are you... What brings you here?

313
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,030
I came looking for Sunbae Yoo Jeong.

314
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,490
Why look for him here? He left a while ago.

315
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:08,710
Why are you getting angry?

316
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,150
Seriously this...

317
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,480
Yes, Professor. Yes.

318
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,150
Reports? Should I bring them to you now? Yes, yes.

319
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,860
Yes, where to?

320
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,880
Yes.

321
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,320
<i>The day is terribly long.</i>

322
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,110
<i>Even getting help from Sunbae...</i>

323
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:39,350
The repair cost to fix this...Just how much would I have to spend...

324
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,890
My USB.

325
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,680
Why did I take this?

326
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,610
Isn't that mine?

327
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:25,870
Anyway, you didn't write it yourself.

328
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,330
What?

329
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,550
- You seriously...<br> - I heard everything earlier.

330
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,930
That you wouldn't have been able to turn it in without Sunbae's help.

331
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:41,230
Must you go that far to get an A+?

332
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,650
Whether I got Sunbae's help or not,

333
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:49,150
<i>what were you going to do with this? Don't you think you have been too much since last year?</i>

334
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,950
Do you like Sunbae Yoo Jeong that much?

335
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,210
Yeah, I like him!

336
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,090
You... After seeing Sunbae Yoo Jeong treat me as special, you must have wanted it too.

337
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:01,010
You don't have a chance. So stop hanging around him.

338
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:05,630
Or else, it won't end with just your report next time.

339
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,170
Are you guys filming a morning drama? It's my first time seeing a fight over love.

340
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:14,830
Girls fighting is really no joke. You've become a character in a drama.

341
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,850
Sunbae, it's all a misunderstanding.

342
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,610
Seol, go turn in your report. It's past the deadline.

343
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:31,250
Joo Yeon.

344
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,330
Yes, Sunbae.

345
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,130
I'll pretend I didn't hear what you said just now. And properly apologize to Seol later.

346
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,030
Sunbae, wait a minute.

347
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,650
Also I... have never treated you as special.

348
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,250
Let's go.

349
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,810
We're going.

350
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:55,250
Professor, here.

351
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,430
The deadline has already passed.

352
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,090
Yes, I also know that.

353
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:02,750
If you know then there's no need to explain. Take it back.

354
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:07,790
No, Professor, can't you accept it just this once?

355
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,550
There really was a situation...

356
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:15,010
Hey, do you think it's fair that I accept this right now?

357
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,650
Yes?

358
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:21,050
Oh, Yoo Jeong, what brings you here?

359
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:27,210
Professor, to be honest it's my fault. I accidentally left out Seol's report.

360
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,970
- You left it out?<br> - Yes.

361
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,330
Instead, can't you just take some points off of my report and accept Seol's?

362
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:35,350
Please do me this favor.

363
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:38,610
You're saying it was your mistake, not Seol's?

364
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,370
Yes, Professor.

365
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,510
It can't be helped then.

366
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,070
Thank you.

367
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:53,250
But the fact is that your report was submitted after the deadline. So I can't give it higher than a B+, understood?

368
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,190
Both of you head out.

369
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,610
<i>If the report is a B+</i>

370
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,390
<i>then I have to get a 100% on the both the test and the team project, and the maximum I can get is an A in the class.</i>

371
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,970
Are you okay?

372
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,650
Yes. Thank you for today.

373
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,650
Looks like I'm doing nothing but receiving help all day long.

374
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:29,530
Have strength. I'll help you with the test and the team project.

375
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,130
<i>Is he being sincere?</i>

376
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,970
<i>Ah, I really don't know anymore.</i>

377
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,410
Right, Seol, about lunch...

378
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,690
You don't eat lunch, right?

379
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,550
- Start!<br> - I'm starting.

380
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,260
Min (Soo)... ?

381
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,590
- Did I see that wrong?<br> - Is someone regarding this as a joke?

382
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,130
Isn't that Sunbae Sang Cheol's writing?

383
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,750
- Hey... <br> - Da Yeong.

384
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,930
Joo Yeon has a heart. Aii...

385
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,090
Hey what the heck? What?

386
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:09,390
- Next, next, next.<br> - Bo Ra!

387
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,930
Her eyeballs pop out too much.

388
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:15,670
What do you mean her eyeballs pop out? You are being too harsh.

389
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,510
Hey, I've been waiting here for twenty minutes! You better run over here quickly!

390
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,610
I'm doing something important right now so I'm hanging up.

391
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,330
- Now, next!<br> - Next!

392
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:27,610
Bo Ra!

393
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,910
She's as short as a dwarf's poop sack.

394
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,590
A dwarf's poop sack?

395
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:32,710
But at least she can walk around.

396
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,530
She's taller than you, you know?

397
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,490
Come on, next.

398
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:39,150
- Joo Yeon.<br> - Hey!

399
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,090
I have dibs on Joo Yeon.

400
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,970
The last one, the last one!

401
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:46,570
Bo Ra!

402
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:48,150
- Quiet, quiet, quiet!<br> - Why?

403
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:51,390
- What are you going to do if the girls find out?<br> - How would they find out?

404
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:54,070
What do you think would happen if we find out?

405
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,990
Hey! What the heck are you doing here right now?

406
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:59,910
Come here! Won't you come here?

407
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,890
Hey! You're not going to come here?! Come here!

408
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,360
But anyway...

409
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,250
Hey, so who likes Bo Ra?

410
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:07,770
You do, Sunbae-nim.

411
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,350
Gross! Look at it, it's wet.

412
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:14,250
Hey! We hven't done this ulzzang (pretty face) voting since elementary school.

413
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:17,070
How old are you, seriously? How many girls did you list?

414
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,990
- About eight.<br> - So, who was number one?

415
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,930
It was you, of course.

416
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,030
Then, what about Seol?

417
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:26,530
For Seol Noona, she tied for last place with Noona Min Soo.

418
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:29,890
What?! Seol and Son Min Soo tied for last?

419
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,830
How did that happen?

420
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,710
I mean... there is quite a difference between how guys and girls perceive these things.

421
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:39,870
This won't do. She needs to go on a blind date.

422
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,470
How did the situation turn into a blind date all of a sudden?

423
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,810
There's this fatally charming guy that I wanted to go on a blind date with--

424
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:47,850
Noona, you were planning to go on a blind date?

425
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:50,890
Yeah, but I think I should pass him along to Seol.

426
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,090
What do you think? It's a good idea, right?

427
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,570
It's totally a good idea.

428
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,570
Right?

429
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,750
There are no seats.

430
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,690
<i>Hong! I have something to talk to you about.</i>

431
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,110
<i>Come out to the lobby of the library.</i>

432
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,870
- Did you get seats?<br> - There aren't any seats.

433
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:22,210
I will reject any rejection. Got it?

434
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,330
- What's with you guys? What's wrong?<br> - A blind date.

435
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,930
She said he is a really fatally charming guy. If you don't meet him it's your loss.

436
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:33,290
You guys are really too much! The midterm is around the corner. Why are you talking about a blind date?

437
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,310
Hey, you can do the blind date after the midterms!

438
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,070
- Hey!<br> - You'll do it, right?

439
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:39,050
- Forget it.<br> - Did you get seats in the library?

440
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:40,930
Hello.

441
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,750
Hi, Seol.

442
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:49,650
Sunbae, I had a seat saved already at the library. You're going to sit and study with me, right?

443
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,310
Hey. You got a seat saved? How'd you do that?

444
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,090
I stayed here all night.

445
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,110
I'll look, myself.

446
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:00,690
Hey Seol, if there's an extra seat, I'll save it for you.

447
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,690
- You didn't save a seat for me? <br> - How can I save a seat for you too, Oppa?

448
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,950
She is so hateful, everything she does is nasty.

449
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,430
Seol, you're going to do it, right? Hm?

450
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:14,610
Hey, let go. There really aren't any seats...

451
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,850
- Hey!<br> - Yes?

452
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,430
Do you think your club room is empty?

453
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,490
There's no one in our club room right now.

454
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,650
- Really?<br> - Use it.

455
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,590
-The password! Password! <br> - If I tell you...

456
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,630
- The password!!<br> - 1234.

457
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:35,070
That's great. There, you can consider the blind date by yourself, okay?

458
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,610
- Fatally...<br> - Got it.

459
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,410
- I got it! <br> - Hey! Even his name is killer! It's Ahn Chi Myeong!

460
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,770
- You have to do it! Okay?<br> - I will use the room well!

461
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,830
<i>Where are you, Sunbae? Did you find a seat?</i>

462
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:52,040
<i>Why didn't you come?</i>

463
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,420
- Hey!<br> - Omo!

464
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,360
Who are you?

465
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,770
I'm your Sunbae!

466
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:06,780
What the heck?

467
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,810
- Why are you being like this? <br> Is it because I look like this?

468
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:14,540
Life is all about one moment. Your life can collapse in just one moment.

469
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,520
Do you know? There are such things!

470
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,840
I understand, Ajusshi.

471
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,840
Do you have money?

472
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:27,260
You shouldn't do this here, but there. Do you see the light on the second floor?

473
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,670
O-Over there?

474
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:34,350
Yeah, if you go there, a girl who will listen to you will be waiting.

475
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,670
Try going there.

476
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:39,180
If the kids were drinking, there should be some alcohol left.

477
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:45,180
These kids... They're drinking when they should be studying. Give me a 1,000 won ($1) bill.

478
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,690
That girl will give it to you.

479
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:50,370
I'll go then.

480
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,660
Okay, bye bye.

481
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,120
The second floor.

482
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:07,650
Yeah. Those points that I lost because of Hong Seol, I will pay her back.

483
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,700
The money isn't here. Ah, jeez.

484
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,690
Life is alcohol, alcohol.

485
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:37,910
You guys think this world is yours, huh?

486
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,090
Where is that girl?

487
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:53,010
Hey! Where did everyone go? Hey!

488
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,990
<i>What was that?</i>

489
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,050
Sunbae! Sunbae, wait a minute!

490
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,010
You were here? I was looking for you everywhere. You weren't even answering your phone.

491
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,010
What is it?

492
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:20,210
Please help me. Right now, Seol is in danger.

493
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:24,920
I was coming out from the library, and it looked like Seol was getting into a quarrel with some homeless guy.

494
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:30,510
Ajusshi asked for some money but Seol told him to get lost and yelled at him and pushed him.

495
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,830
Then she went into the club building.

496
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,440
But I think the Ajusshi got mad and followed her into the building with an alcohol bottle.

497
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,210
You know how Seol sometimes speaks harshly.

498
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,160
The truth is, that's what had happened yesterday with her.

499
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,300
The fact that you and I were close, Seol has always disliked it.

500
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:55,010
Even so, the situation earlier wasn't something I could ignore. She is a classmate and a girl.

501
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:57,770
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

502
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:05,570
But Joo Yeon, the club building is in the opposite direction of here.

503
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:08,950
If you were really worried about Seol, you should've gone to the security guard who is in the next building.

504
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:14,720
But you came to me when I wasn't even answering my phone. Something's a little off, right?

505
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:18,820
You've caused this mess, so fix it yourself.

506
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,880
Hey! Are you sleeping?

507
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,660
I'm scared.

508
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:42,690
Huh? Wake up, wake up!

509
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,760
Ah, jeez.

510
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,610
Oh, hey! Come here, come here!

511
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:53,580
Where are you going? She said you want to listen to me!

512
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,750
Are you ignoring me? You think, you can do that?

513
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,450
You are just like that department head!

514
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,360
Ajusshi, hold on a minute!

515
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,790
Ah, where in the world is he?

516
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:04,900
A homeless guy came on campus?

517
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,380
I don't know. We need to hurry and head up!

518
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,330
- You think you can just fire me because you're the department head?<br> - Ahjussi! Ahjussi!

519
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,450
- Look what's happened to me!

520
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,810
Why did this break?

521
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,570
What do you think you're doing?

522
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,330
Student, please get up.

523
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,790
What are you doing here?

524
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,750
- She's the right person.<br> - You're very drunk!

525
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,590
Come out!

- Yes.<br> - Is that saved on your laptop?

- Yes, why?<br> - Let me borrow it.

- You have to hurry up and give it back. Okay?<br> - All right.

My personality is really a bit on the sensitive side and I judge people based on how I feel...

619

So sometimes I misunderstand people.

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,730
- Sunbae, I know you want to take it but...<br> - One, two three.

630
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,580
I really don't...

631
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,810
Look. It came out well, didn't it?

632
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,840
I said I don't want to... How do you think this looks good?

633
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,000
Why? It's cute.

634
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,410
I think you should delete it. How do you delete it?

635
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,970
I think you should delete it.

636
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,570
But my eyes.

637
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,500
- I think you should delete this.<br> - What's with you?

638
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,000
Sunbae, you're the only one who came out well.

639
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,200
<i>1 year ago. Start of Semester Party</i>

640
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,250
<i>That jerk. He's not pitiful. He embarrassed me.</i>

641
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:01,590
<i>We should send him back to the military.</i>

642
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:05,730
<i>Getting involved with Kim Sang Cheol just keeps putting me in humiliating situations.</i>

643
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:11,000
<i>It's seriously annoying. I'm so embarrassed, I can't go to school.</i>

644
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,780
<i>Jae Woo.</i>

645
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,760
<i>What is it?</i>

646
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,380
<i>Are you going home?</i>

647
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,940
<i>Yeah.</i>

648
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,810
<i>You're having a hard time because of Sang Cheol Sunbae, right?</i>

649
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:29,370
<i>Are you laughing at me too right now?</i>

650
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,710
<i>How am I laughing at you? Think about it.</i>

651
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,250
<i>Between Sang Cheol Sunbae, who harasses people for no reason, and you,</i>

652
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,260
<i>who would I think is weird?</i>

653
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,200
<i>So what do you want me to do about it?</i>

654
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,030
<i>Everyone knows Sang Cheol is weird. He harasses you more because you allow it.</i>

655
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,290
<i>Are you just going to keep allowing it?</i>

656
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:54,150
<i>When did I?! I always said that I didn't like it!</i>

657
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:57,420
<i>That's not enough, which is the problem.</i>

658
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,030
<i>Jae Woo.</i>

659
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:01,040
<i>What now?</i>

660
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,670
<i>Here.</i>

661
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,730
<i>This is the receipt from today. Would you give it to Sang Cheol Sunbae?</i>

662
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:14,250
<i>Of course, he isn't the type to keep track of such things.</i>

663
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,590
<i>Why are you giving this to me?</i>

664
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:20,730
<i>Just throw it away then.</i>

665
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,030
<i>Gosh.</i>

666
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:32,120
<i>I think there were over twenty people there.</i>

667
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:35,420
<i>He said he ran out of funds, but it looks like he took some for himself again.</i>

668
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,150
<i>Kim Sang Cheol, I've caught you now.</i>

669
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,930
<i>No, I like both.</i>

670
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,490
<i>Can't you please delete it?</i>

671
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:44,820
<i>Cute, right? I'll send it to you, too.</i>

672
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,680
<i>No, no, it's okay. Please delete it.</i>

673
00:44:52,940 --> 00:45:00,000
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ viki. com </i>

674
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,870
My eyes.

675
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,780
Oh, Ah Yeong.

676
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,820
<i>What are you doing tomorrow? I have a canceled class, so let's eat together.</i>

677
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:22,470
Sure. My last class ends at 4 tomorrow, do you want to meet then?

678
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,300
<i>Yeah, that's good. By the way,</i>

679
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,330
I saw Sunbae Yoo Jeong again not long ago. When I said hi, he remembered my name.

680
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:33,030
<i>And he bought my friends and me some beverages.</i>

681
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:36,400
<i>So what I'm saying is...</i>

682
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,970
Could you help me hook up with Yoo Jeong?

683
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:46,200
<i>As I've gotten to know Sunbae, he seems like a decent person.</i>

684
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,180
Sure.

685
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,190
Really? Thank you so much.

686
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,690
Hong Seol!

687
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,500
What are you doing? Where are you headed?

688
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,150
Pick her up!

689
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,630
- What is this?<br> - She is not heavy!

690
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:08,100
- What are you doing?<br> - Not heavy!

691
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,560
Put me down!

692
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,050
- Be quiet!<br> - Stay still!

693
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,840
Stay still, stay still!

694
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,030
Hey, hold on! Hey!

695
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:19,560
Eun Taek, stand guard!

696
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,210
Why are you doing this? Hey!

697
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,950
Take this off.

698
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:34,470
- What are you doing?<br>- It's fine.

699
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:40,380
No, I don't want to!

700
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,980
Stop it.

701
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:56,540
Tada! Please look at my artwork. What do you think?

702
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,800
She's pretty, right?

703
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,170
Wow, I think you'll get about three more votes than Min Soo now.

704
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:05,570
Hey, it's today at 6, so don't be late.

705
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:09,610
You must not disappoint fatally charming Mr. Ahn Chi Myeong. Got it?

706
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,620
You look complete.

707
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,190
Hello.

708
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:28,190
Today...

709
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:30,640
I look weird, right?

710
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,440
No, you look pretty.

711
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,980
Because I have somewhere to go today. It's true.

712
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,280
<i>Unni, what time should I go to the cafeteria today?</i>

713
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,080
<i>Then, should I do it today?</i>

714
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:53,590
<i>Since class ends at 4 and my blind date is at 6.</i>

715
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:56,150
- Sunbae.<br> - Yeah?

716
00:47:56,150 --> 00:48:01,150
Perhaps, do you have time today? After class ends...

717
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,550
Okay, sure.

718
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,460
<i>4:30 PM at the cafeteria. Okay.</i>

719
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:18,420
It's a little early for dinner, isn't it?

720
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,580
It is a little early.

721
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,150
I know, right?

722
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,940
Even so, it's nice that there aren't many people.

723
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,700
- Unni!<br> - Oh, Ah Yeong!

724
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,760
You look pretty today.

725
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,860
You also look really pretty today. What's up?

726
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,800
Oh, stop.

727
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:38,890
Ah Yeong said she didn't eat yet either. Can she join us?

728
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,000
Of course. Have you been well?

729
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,910
Yes. I've been totally well.

730
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,140
<i>Good. That was casual.</i>

731
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,990
- You eat this first.<br> - Ah, thank you.

732
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:50,900
- Yes.<br> - Go over there.

733
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,550
Let's go.

734
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,290
I really like being a college student.

735
00:48:56,290 --> 00:49:02,080
I'm taking the Art of Music, and the professor is so great...

736
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:04,770
I'm only talking about myself. Sorry.

737
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:06,990
No, it was interesting.

738
00:49:06,990 --> 00:49:12,340
Ah Yeong, you still don't have a boyfriend?

739
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,550
I don't have one.

740
00:49:14,550 --> 00:49:17,420
Why? I would've thought you were popular.

741
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:21,140
Right? Ah Yeong's skin is so fair,

742
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:25,450
and she's pretty, so she's really popular with people.

743
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:30,290
And her features are so bright, that she looks like a goddess in pictures.

744
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:35,660
There are so many people who contact her after just seeing her profile picture.

745
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,190
Ah, no. Unni, you're going overboard.

746
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:43,280
But, you two would really suit each other.

747
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,180
<i>I really did go overboard.</i>

748
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,290
Want to drink coffee?

749
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,200
Coffee?

750
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,980
I'll go get some coffee.

751
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,900
Here.

752
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,300
You're not drinking any?

753
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:14,870
No, I have something to take care of.

754
00:50:14,870 --> 00:50:17,580
Please enjoy the rest of your meal. I'll be going.

755
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:25,670
Isn't she really pretty today? I wish she'd dress like that every day.

756
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,670
Yeah.

757
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,870
The truth is, she has a blind date today.

758
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:35,460
She's probably nervous since it's her first blind date. I hope it's someone nice.

759
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,470
A blind date?

760
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:40,860
Yes. Unni Bo Ra set them up.

761
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,820
So, um...

762
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:48,870
Please just tell me without beating around the bush. So what's the conclusion?

763
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:51,430
Can I work here or not?

764
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:54,640
To work here in our restaurant, um...

765
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,730
your appearance isn't quite right...

766
00:50:56,730 --> 00:51:00,310
Ah, this is so frustrating, I'm going crazy.

767
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,410
Mr. Kim Byeong Ho.

768
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:07,520
I just came to Seoul from out of town and just got a room that I can't afford.

769
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,170
So I'm staying in a gositel that doesn't even cost $300 a month. But your restaurant is right in front of it. (gositel = hostel for students)

770
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,360
- It's my destiny to work here.<br> - I'm sorry. I'll be going first.

771
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,990
Where are you going in the middle of an interview? Mr. Kim Byeong Ho!

772
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:20,100
Mr. Kim Byeong Ho! Mr. Kim Byeong Ho!

773
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,860
What are your hobbies? By any chance, do you like surfing?

774
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,460
That...

775
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:30,810
Last year I went to Gol-Co (Gold Coast) to learn how to surf. You know Gol-Co, don't you?

776
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:33,820
The Gold Coast? Have you been there before?

777
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:35,530
No, I've never been there.

778
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:38,200
Ah, so you're not into water sports.

779
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:41,690
Then, anything else? Golf or tennis?

780
00:51:41,690 --> 00:51:45,350
Or a little more on the wild side, like paragliding?

781
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,800
No, I haven't done any of that.

782
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,230
Then what have you done in life?

783
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,780
Ah, when I was young, I learned the piano.

784
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:02,380
Then you must know the piece that's playing now. Schubert's piano quartet, "Mullet." <br>(<i> It's the Trout Quintet.</i>0

785
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:05,220
<i>I should endure it. Bo Ra introduced me to him.</i>

786
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,430
- So you don't even know such things.<br> - <i>Endure it.</i>

787
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:10,790
You've lived a very uninteresting life. Can we even relate?

788
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:13,640
Ah, I can't listen to this crap.

789
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:17,840
Who brags about himself so much while looking like a pervert.

790
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh!

791
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,020
He was treating you like a beggar without cause, so I was wondering how great he was.

792
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:27,270
But he's not much at all. How did you meet this guy who looks like a slippery eel?

793
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,790
Slippery eel? Do you know this person?

794
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:33,220
Even if there are no men around, why meet a guy like this? So pathetic.

795
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,160
- Why are you doing this?<br> - So, do you want me to take care of him?

796
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,660
Pathetic? This guy... hey, are you finished?

797
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,730
We're in the middle of talking. You should be quiet.

798
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:44,750
Where did this guy come from? This shabby appearance and looking like gangster.

799
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:47,330
- Is this bastard crazy?<br> - Wait!

800
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,980
Do you have the money to compensate for hitting a guy like this?

801
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:53,070
If you have that kind of money, then give me the repair costs for my laptop.

802
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,560
Laptop? What are you saying now?

803
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:58,720
Why did I even come here?

804
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,640
You bastard.

805
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:05,210
Hey. You manage to get guys to follow you around.

806
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,190
While oozing with unsophistication.

807
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:10,260
Bastard, you must really be crazy.

808
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:13,080
Yes, I've lived an unsophisticated, boring life.

809
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:17,070
So, what? What has it done for you?

810
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:23,150
"Mullet Quartet"?! You look all greasy, just smeared with butter.

811
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:27,480
But what's with that folksy pronunciation? Don't use English anywhere!

812
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,110
It's embarrassing even for me to hear.

813
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:33,040
She's totally insane.

814
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,970
That girl...

815
00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:38,370
Where are you going? If you're going to brag, do it properly.

816
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:43,070
First of all, that's a piano quintet. And it's not "Mullet" but "Trout," you rockbrain.

817
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,710
You didn't study, did you? Even a bum like me knows that.

818
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:49,040
Sit down.

819
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:51,730
There's something bad that came up at home, sorry.

820
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:53,820
Hey!

821
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,190
Sunbae.

822
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,390
What are you doing here?

823
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:36,730
Did you enjoy the meal today?

824
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,560
With Ah Yeong...

825
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,560
Lately,

826
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,170
I thought we'd gotten close.

827
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,520
But you also had a reason for approaching me.

828
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:10,610
You're the same as everyone else.

829
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,880
It's hard to eat even one meal with you.

830
00:55:42,860 --> 00:55:46,170
Wow, what kind of phone is this?

831
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,630
This girl is quite frugal, really.

832
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:52,370
Who uses a crap phone like this these days?

833
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:57,850
I can't get anything out of it by selling it. I should return it to her for a meal at least.

834
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:01,980
Sunbae Yoo Jeong?

835
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:04,760
Yoo Jeong?!

836
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:08,870
Surely it can't be, there aren't just one or two Yoo Jeongs in Korea.

837
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:11,680
Don't think useless things.

838
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:19,100
What is this?

839
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:23,820
Those two are dating?!

840
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,860
Why are her eyes open like this?

841
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:31,070
Wow, it's really a small world.

842
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,580
Wow!

843
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,700
Wait, so this means she's Yoo Jeong's girlfriend, right?

844
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:44,010
If that's how it is...

845
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:51,560
Sunbae Yoo Jeong, just you wait. I'll give this bastard a surprise.

846
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,200
<i>Seol</i>

847
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:08,470
Talk.

848
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,930
It has been a while, Yoo Jeong.

849
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,550
Baek In Ho?

850
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:18,190
Wow, what an honor! You recognized me at once.

851
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,530
How do you..?

852
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:26,490
Where are you?

853
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:52,800
It's been a while, Yoo Jeong.

854
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:59,310
- What happened?<br> - If you do that, that makes me sad.

855
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:01,920
We haven't seen each other in years and you don't ask how I am?

856
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,020
Do we have that kind of relationship?

857
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,020
Right.

858
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,950
We definitely do not have that kind of relationship.

859
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,290
- Give me her phone.<br> - What kind of relationship do you have with her?

860
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:22,760
Just who is she that you even take a picture together

861
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,680
and that you'd run here in a flash to fetch a crap phone like this.

862
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,000
It's none of your concern.

863
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,300
Then, I'll just ask her myself.

864
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,240
But, does she know or not?

865
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:36,020
What kind of bastard you are?

866
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,430
Don't hang around people who are around me.

867
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:42,240
If I do, what are you going to do about it?

868
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:46,310
Ah, you'll do the same thing you did back then?

869
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:49,380
You're still bringing that up?

870
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:53,460
I thought since you came back that you'd come to your senses,

871
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,820
but I guess you haven't changed at all.

872
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:57,490
You're the one who really hasn't changed.

873
00:58:57,490 --> 00:59:03,230
You ruined a person's life and you appear to have no guilt at all.

874
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:06,270
Guilt?

875
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,520
Why would I?

876
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,060
Listen carefully.

877
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:31,400
When I graduate and join Father's company, our relations with you and Baek In Ha will completely end.

878
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,410
I let it go because I felt pity for you both, but it will be hard to continue.

879
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,620
Pity?

880
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:42,670
Be sure to let your sister know there aren't many years left.

881
00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:45,430
You should find a way to make a living before then.

882
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,420
Don't try anything weird and return her phone to her.

883
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:32,080
What was I expecting?

884
