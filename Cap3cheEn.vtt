<i>Cheese in the Trap</i>

2
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,630
<i>Cheese in the Trap</i>

3
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,500
<i>Seol. Seol. Seol!</i>

4
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,820
<i> A suspicious sunbae has started acting suspiciously. </i>

5
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,890
<i>Behind that smile, there's a scary double side to him that's hiding.</i>

6
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,350
<i>- Take a picture with me.<br> - Come to your senses, Hong Seol.</i>

7
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,440
<i>- I can't fall for that smile. <br>- It's nice to see you again. <br>- What? </i>

8
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,040
<i>Hey, Dog Hair! Dog Hair.</i>

9
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,210
<i>- Me?<br> - Dog Hair.<br> - Look here!</i>

10
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,610
My biggest stress is from you sticking onto me.

11
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,780
What's your relationship with her?

12
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,660
<i>Don't lurk near the people around me.</i>

13
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,310
<i>Could you help set me up with Yoo Jeong?</i>

14
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,070
<i>Lately, I thought we'd gotten close.</i>

15
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,340
<i>But you also had a reason for approaching me.</i>

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,350
<i>In the end you're the same as everyone else.</i>

17
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:50,870
<i>I think Sunbae is really angry.</i>

18
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,890
<i>Because I set him up with Ah Yeong without his permission? </i>

19
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,130
<i>Is that really something to get so angry about?</i>

20
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:01,920
Ah, I don't know.

21
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,220
Why is this so hard?

22
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,320
<i>Episode 3</i>

23
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,860
Explain it to me first.

24
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,530
<i>As far as justice goes...</i>

25
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,460
- Ask Jeong. <br> - Hello.

26
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,800
<i>It's just like last year.</i>

27
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,570
<i>That cold back I've seen countless times.</i>

28
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,440
- I said I'd do that! <br> - What are you doing?

29
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,220
Sunbae.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,210
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

31
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,450
Okay, sure.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,350
Uh, the thing with Ah Yeong,

33
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:54,230
- I didn't mean to do that on purpose--<br>- I'm in the middle of talking right now.

34
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:01,050
I really don't have it.

35
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,620
You all look happy.

36
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,800
I have some news that should make you feel better.

37
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,170
The end of the term PT (presentation) subject and groups

38
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,140
I posted the information on the class website, so go and check it.

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,260
Is there a problem?

40
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,980
You're calling me Witch Kang in your thoughts, right?

41
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,090
I think I'm the happiest when I give out homework.

42
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:30,180
Now, for this team project,

43
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,790
the most important thing I'm going to look at is how you work together.

44
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm telling you this beforehand,

45
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,820
anyone who thinks they can get by on someone's else's back for free,

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,180
don't get caught. If you're caught, it's an "all kill" for the entire team. An "all kill."

47
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,100
Hong Seol! Do you understand?

48
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:52,030
- Yes.<br> - Okay. Now.

49
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,570
Now, check which group you're in and gather into your groups.

50
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,140
Who knew I'd be on the same team as my junior Hong?

51
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,590
You know I'm retaking this class, right? Let's do well.

52
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:08,110
Me too. Take good care of me, Seol.

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,540
It's really nice to be in the same team, Seol.

54
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,330
Now, now, now. We've already decided who the leader is, right?

55
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:18,130
The leader of our 5th group is Hong Seol!

56
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:21,050
<i>This semester really isn't going to be easy.</i>

57
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:24,970
Hong Seol! Hong Seol! Do it!

58
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,210
Back there, are we at MT?

59
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:31,040
I'm sorry. Hong Seol, yeah!

60
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,850
PT Hong, Hong PT

61
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,180
I survived.

62
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,710
- Text her.<br>- I'm fine.

63
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:44,860
- Let's get ready for the team project. <br>- Why me?

64
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,110
<i>I definitely said sorry and apologized,</i>

65
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:52,080
<i>but Sunbae just said, "Okay, sure," and accepted it.</i>

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,500
<i>Then, that's that.</i> He's angry. Totally angry.

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,990
- Why in the world...<br> <i>- You also had a reason for approaching me.</i>

68
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,310
- I also did?<br> <i> - In the end you're the same as everyone else.</i>

69
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,290
Was he expecting me to be different from everyone else?

70
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:16,360
Why me? What?

71
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,490
Ah, I really have no idea.

72
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,930
Want to have lunch together?

73
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:31,300
Oh, I already have plans for lunch.

74
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,850
- Oh, okay.<br> - Unni!<br> - Oh, Ah Yeong.

75
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,450
Min Soo, let's eat together next time!

76
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,870
So I couldn't reach you because you lost your phone.

77
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,310
Did you also get home okay yesterday?

78
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,620
Why? Did Yoo Jeong Sunbae say something?

79
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,150
That's not it.

80
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,080
<i>Are you close with Seol Unni?</i>

81
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,890
<i>Once you left,</i>

82
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,830
<i>he didn't say anything and just sat there.</i>

83
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,460
I felt this for the first time.

84
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,700
That he was cold and scary.

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,120
It felt like I had become an object.

86
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,950
He only asked one thing before leaving—where your house was.

87
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,390
I told him your address.

88
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,020
Sunbae didn't look for you?

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,940
Did I make it difficult for you because of my strange request?

90
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,210
No.

91
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,250
- No.<br> - But,

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,070
there's something I'm picking up on.

93
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,320
- I think that sunbae likes you.<br> - What?!

94
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,650
Hey, that's not it! You're saying nonsense!

95
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,480
I think I'm right.

96
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,810
He suddenly turned cold after I told him about your blind date.

97
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:56,510
He was jealous and angry over your blind date.

98
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,540
I'm positive.

99
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:05,580
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ viki. com </i>

100
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,930
Why is she spacing out?

101
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,630
<i>He likes me? Me?</i>

102
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,340
<i>Sunbae?</i> Does that make sense?

103
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,870
Ah, seriously. Don't go overboard, Hong Seol.

104
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:26,590
Is it serious? Is it worse?

105
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,350
- What?<br> - No.

106
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,720
She was spacing out until earlier, but now she's in a mental breakdown.

107
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,940
- Really? <br>-I think we should turn ourselves in before it gets worse.

108
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,980
She doesn't usually get mad, but it's really scary once she does.

109
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,110
She hasn't answered any of my calls since yesterday, and she's ignoring my texts.

110
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,070
- Why did you have to introduce such a fatal kind of guy to Noona Hong—<br>- If you say that one more time... Be quiet!

111
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,470
Do you think this meal ticket can make amends?

112
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:56,970
Give it. Let's try.

113
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,270
Hong! Hi!

114
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,530
Don't even try.

115
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:14,740
Ah, Hong, I love you! I only have you!

116
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,750
No, it won't work on me.

117
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,380
I'm going to meet Ahn Chi Myung today. Where should I hit him?

118
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:27,700
- His face? His hips? His legs?<br> - Stop it!<br> - Why are you hitting me?

119
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,170
- I'm going to go find my phone.<br> - Huh?

120
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,910
You lost your phone?

121
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,560
- You weren't ignoring my calls?<br> - That's right.

122
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,070
This girl. Where did you leave your cellphone? I was worried.

123
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,790
- Try again.<br> - The battery isn't dead, is it?<br> <i>- Hello?</i>

124
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,170
- Hello? Hello?<br> <i>- Hello?</i>

125
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,760
Wow, her eyes really do look like that. Hey!

126
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,980
Hello.

127
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,330
Ma'am, please give me two more.

128
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,650
Sit down.

129
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,480
Eat, eat.

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:21,730
- Eat slowly. I'll just take my phone...<br> - Hey.

131
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,100
First eat. I'll give it to you after we eat.

132
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:36,070
- Are you dating Yoo Jeong?<br> - What?

133
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,280
- Do you know Sunbae Yoo Jeong?<br> - Sunbae?

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,270
Right, you aren't Yoo Jeong's type.

135
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,190
Your hair is like dog hair.

136
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,790
And what's that? Pigtails?

137
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,340
One, two, three, four, five.

138
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,540
Look here.

139
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:57,270
- Your words are harsh. <br>- Sorry.

140
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,910
Wait. Then, what?

141
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,030
Is he following you around? And you're meeting another guy?

142
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,370
That bastard isn't that kind of bastard.

143
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,720
Then, what about you? What kind of relationship do you have with Sunbae Yoo Jeong?

144
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,260
I'm not so sure.

145
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,980
Let's go.

146
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,120
Your order hasn't come out yet.

147
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,580
Ma'am, please pack my order to go.

148
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,220
I enjoyed the meal.

149
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:31,980
Goodbye.

150
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,980
two orders of 16,000... 32,000 won.

151
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,450
How much is it?

152
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,420
It's 124,000 won.

153
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,380
<i>124,000 won?</i>

154
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,540
<i>The beef I don't get to eat, this guy.</i>

155
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,780
Here. You have two more times left.

156
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,780
I found this stupid phone for you.

157
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,940
This is a basic form of thanks.

158
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:07,860
Your expression is weird. I'm going.

159
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,160
You should wear something that's more dazzling.

160
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,750
Because your face is dull, you need to wear something like that so you can stand out.

161
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,680
Okay, I'll give you one more tip for free.

162
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm speaking from experience,

163
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,630
be careful of that bastard, Yoo Jeong. He's not all what he seems.

164
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,840
I'm going.

165
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,730
<i>That person... Who is he to talk so badly about sunbae? </i>

166
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,570
What is it?

167
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,410
I'm so frustrated.

168
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,890
What the heck?

169
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,690
Did you follow me?

170
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,660
What?

171
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,000
Why are you following me?

172
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,900
How ridiculous. You followed <i>me</i>.

173
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,460
See? I'm in front and you're behind. Are you an idiot?

174
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,560
But, you live here?

175
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,130
- No, I don't.<br> - Hey.

176
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,580
I think you do live here.

177
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,590
N-No, I don't.

178
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,530
Then, why did you come here?

179
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,990
Where did I leave my mind?

180
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,790
You do live here!

181
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,070
No, I said I don't!

182
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,310
That girl, she really is stupid. She's so bad at lying.

183
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,990
That means she lives around here.

184
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,990
It should be fun when that bastard Yoo Jeong finds out.

185
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,420
You do live here!

186
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,270
I'll enjoy the food!

187
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,220
What? We're in the same neighborhood?

188
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,970
It's strange that we're in the exact same one.

189
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,630
<i> - See you later, Dog Hair. - Baek In Ho</i><br> - "See you later, Dog Hair." Baek In Ho?

190
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,560
What? My phone number!

191
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,690
What's with this person?

192
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,600
<i>This person is really strange. How much does he intend to rip off me that he saves my number? </i>

193
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,020
It's strange.

194
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,940
Now then...

195
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,850
Sunbae.

196
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,830
Oh, okay, okay, okay. Go on.

197
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:58,060
So our presentation will be about LN Electric's success strategy in South Africa.

198
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,910
Sunbae Sang Cheol, you will do a study on the electronics market in South Africa.

199
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,680
But how can I research all of South Africa?

200
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,510
It's all in English, and it's a country that I haven't been to.

201
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,080
Oppa. Open your bag and talk.

202
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,930
I can smell alcohol over here. Did you wash your face?

203
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,640
I did.

204
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,040
Seol. I'm really sorry, but could you take some of my part?

205
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,750
But each of our parts require similar amounts of work.

206
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:33,200
Seol. Where do we find the materials?

207
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,530
About LN Electrics...

208
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,240
-Oh? I'm sorry. <br>-Someone's using it.

209
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,460
What? Hey, it's you.

210
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:46,230
Hey, you won't lend my your laptop so I can't do my assignment!

211
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,030
- And I don't have an assignment?<br>- I told you to buy your own.

212
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:50,600
Why would I buy one when I can borrow yours?

213
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,300
- Who is she?<br> - Her?

214
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:56,460
Hello, I'm Hong Seol, Class of 2012.

215
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,710
You're Seol, the one who is really smart. You're top of the class, right?

216
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,840
I'm Min Do Hyeon. This is the first time we've met, right?

217
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,120
- Ah, yes.<br> - Yeah.

218
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,370
Let's go somewhere else. Let's go, Sunbae.

219
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,110
We're almost done here, so...

220
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,320
It smells like alcohol.

221
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,030
Be quiet, and go out.

222
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:19,670
My condition is really bad today. Also, I'm not in the mood to meet.

223
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,960
Meeting done. Let's stop here.

224
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,650
Sunbae, the study on the electronics market...

225
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:27,210
Hey, how can I know about a country I've never been to?

226
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,340
There's a lot of material on it.

227
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:32,960
Do you think he'll do it? He's going to go drink now.

228
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,960
We're ruined, we're ruined.

229
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:41,180
How about concluding that Samjin Department Store should convert to a premium level?

230
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,360
Yeah, that's good. It seems like Samjin Department Store wasn't clear about its target market.

231
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,620
So when I edit the presentation, I'll incorporate our final report.

232
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,540
You'll do it all?

233
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:59,510
Of course, Yoo Jung. Now that my part's done, I'll trust Yoo Jeong and go play around.

234
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,070
I'm going.

235
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,460
Ah, hey. That girl earlier, Hong Seol. She doesn't have a boyfriend, right?

236
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,270
But, why?

237
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:14,410
Usually those model student types have a spicy hot side to them.

238
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,990
Why didn't I know that there was a girl like that in our class until now?

239
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,750
Yoo Jeong, work hard.

240
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,810
I'm going!

241
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,700
Hey, she's studying by herself now.

242
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,400
If I was in that group, I would be done.

243
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,320
But did you know that you two are very similar?

244
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,170
Going easy on everyone else and taking all the losses yourself.

245
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,720
Even if you're like that, what is Hoobae Hong going to do?

246
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,860
How can she stand Sunbae Sang Cheol ? I can't bear him.

247
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,960
<i>Hoobae Hong, let's postpone it for a day. Something urgent came up and I can't make it that day.</i>

248
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,600
<i>We can't. Because everyone's schedule is different.</i>

249
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,430
<i>It's hard to adjust the time again. </i>

250
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,200
<i>Then, just leave me out.</i>

251
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:26,310
<i>There's a part that is assigned to you. How can we do it by leaving you out? </i>

252
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,620
<i>Can't you do it instead of me?</i>

253
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,830
<i>Then, we might be able to get an A+.</i>

254
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:35,450
He's a really weird sunbae.

255
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,030
<i>- No, then do I your part—<br>- Seol.</i>

256
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:44,710
<i>When I put a picture in the report, the writing goes down. What do I do? </i>

257
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:50,050
<i>- Go into Object Properties and—<br>- How do I go into Object Properties?</i>

258
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,390
Ah, why am I doing everything?!

259
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,290
I have to study for the exam too.

260
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,740
<i>I'm suffocating because of you!</i>

261
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,200
<i>Did I do something that bad?</i>

262
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,230
Let's do this quickly.

263
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,790
<i>Why?</i>

264
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:35,390
<i>Just why aren't those guys coming?</i>

265
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,430
<i>What am I supposed to do? </i>

266
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:42,300
<i>Why aren't they coming?</i>

267
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,900
<i>I'm sorry. I fell asleep and couldn't get up.</i>

268
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,820
<i>Should I still go now?</i>

269
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,040
<i>If I hurry up, maybe by 9 o'clock...</i>

270
00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:00,450
<i>I'm really sorry. I suddenly had an emergency.</i>

271
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,320
<i>Seol, this time, please forgive me.</i>

272
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,750
<i>Kim Sang Cheol</i>

273
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,750
<i>Kim Sang Cheol</i>

274
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,700
<i>Let's enjoy going strong again tonight! Drink up!</i>

275
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,260
This sunbae, seriously!

276
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,180
Ah, I don't know.

277
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,700
Hey, hey, because of you...

278
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,050
Hey, have a drink, have a drink.

279
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:35,250
Drink. Cheers!

280
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,230
Hong. What brings you here?

281
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,890
Did you forget our group meeting?

282
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:43,960
Oh that? I had an important gathering today.

283
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,870
- It's important!<br> - Of course, it's important!

284
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,160
Sunbae!

285
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,340
How did you know I was here?

286
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,670
She came here on purpose to let me know about the meeting.

287
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,580
You're so kind, Hong Seol...

288
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,570
Hong Seol. I saw you last time. Why are you here?

289
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,960
Hey, for our team, the A+ is as good as ours.

290
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,520
Because I missed out on the group meeting, my group leader came to me personally. Isn't she awesome?

291
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,260
- Applause! Applause.<br>- You shouldn't skip those meetings.

292
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,470
Give her a glass saying you won't skip them from now on.

293
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,940
No.

294
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,130
He's being sincere, so just have one glass. One glass.

295
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,500
Have a drink. Just one.

296
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,170
Sunbae, what are you doing?

297
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,530
Alright, I got it, I got it.

298
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:27,240
All right, it's given. Pass me the soju.

299
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,580
It's given.

300
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,750
If you drink all of this, I'll work really hard.

301
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,480
I'll make sure we get an A+ next time.

302
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,640
You're not drinking?

303
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:47,340
Hong Hoobae! Hong Hoobae! Hong Hoobae!

304
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,240
Okay!

305
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,340
Wow, that was so great.

306
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,890
I'll work really hard!

307
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,760
What's wrong? You lose something?

308
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:10,040
Yeah, my marketing printouts.

309
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,990
I think Sunbae Do Hyeon was looking at that.

310
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,630
Hello?

311
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:27,730
<i>Yeah, Yoo Jeong. What's up?</i>

312
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,320
I think my materials got mixed up with yours.

313
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,590
They're my marketing printouts.

314
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,520
<i>Oh, wait.</i>

315
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,030
<i>One more drink. Hong Hoobae!</i>

316
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,480
<i>One more drink! One more drink!</i>

317
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,590
<i>Oh, here it is. I took it. What to do?</i>

318
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,600
<i>Hong Hoobae, drink.</i>

319
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,660
I'll go there.

320
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,940
What? Hong Hoobae is there?

321
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,330
- It looks that way.<br> - Wow.

322
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,360
That's really dangerous.

323
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,580
- With that trash-like jerk of all people.<br>- Trash?

324
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,490
He's been famous since freshman year for how dirty he is with women.

325
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,520
He gets them to drink and takes them to a motel when they blackout.

326
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,880
The way he introduced himself to Seol was really greasy.

327
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,050
I'm going first.

328
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,660
Are you okay?

329
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,970
Yes.

330
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,720
What's with them?

331
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,780
I'll be going.

332
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,050
Where are you going? We're just getting started, Hong Hoobae.

333
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,090
- Sunbae.<br> - Huh?

334
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,020
The presentation is right in front of our nose.

335
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,710
Please send me the materials I asked you for. I'll put everything together.

336
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,370
I got it, I got it.

337
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,660
Sunbae, you're older than me.

338
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:51,650
Because of you, our whole team is being hurt.

339
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,550
Please save... Help me. Save me.

340
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,970
Hong Hoobae, I got it.

341
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,380
Yeah, please save her.

342
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,420
- Seol. Seol, wait a minute. Sit down for a minute.<br> - Sunbae, promise. Ah, wait.

343
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,680
Wait, wait.

344
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:08,240
Seol, just finish this and we'll leave, okay? Here.

345
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,910
No.

346
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,140
I want to go.

347
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,800
Ah, then, I'll take you home. I can take you back.

348
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,360
Sunbae. Sunbae, I think you're drunk too. I'll take Seol home.

349
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,400
Jeong.

350
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,080
Jeong, you...

351
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,730
Ah, Sunbae, I can walk.

352
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,500
I told you to take care of yourself. Do you need something bad to happen to you to get your act straight?

353
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,990
But, Sunbae, why are you here?

354
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,970
Why can't you say no? Not everyone is like you.

355
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,620
Sunbae Sang Cheol... Sunbae Sang Cheol...

356
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,820
That hurts.

357
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,350
Pull yourself together, Seol.

358
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,240
Wait.

359
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,780
Ah, Sunbae.

360
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,770
Wait.

361
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,110
- Please take care of her.<br> - A-Ajusshi, wait.

362
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,340
Sunbae, that's not it.

363
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,780
Sunbae!

364
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,510
What's with you?

365
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,630
Since everyone praises how nice you are and adores you, you don't seem to see anything.

366
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,850
Who are you to butt in when I did all the work?

367
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:35,380
I can't do anything about what you do elsewhere.

368
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,660
But it would be nice if you didn't do this on campus, at least.

369
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,230
What?

370
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,790
I heard you're interning during the break.

371
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,480
Does that company know that you go around like this?

372
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,720
Now that I see you like this, you're not so great.

373
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,050
You're making threats without basis.

374
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:54,460
If there's basis or not,

375
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,280
shall we go for it?

376
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,790
It's just that you have let loose so many things.

377
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:04,170
Are you doing this because of Hong Seol?

378
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,140
I just find it loathsome to look at, that's all.

379
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,880
I have a low tolerance, you see.

380
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,060
If you understand me, then be careful.

381
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,650
If you don't want to ever get a job,

382
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,190
and be unemployed forever.

383
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,420
"Pull yourself together"?

384
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,340
What did I do?

385
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,620
This is so tiring.

386
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,000
It's tiring.

387
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,090
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

388
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,320
Yes, Father.

389
00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:05,200
Damn, seriously.

390
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,080
You'll regret this your whole life!

391
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,610
How can he fire me just by looking at my face?

392
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,260
Am I too handsome to be serving?

393
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,980
Is it a crime to be handsome? Huh?

394
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,320
- Yes.<br> <i>- In Ho.</i>

395
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,930
Ajusshi.

396
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,120
That's right. I heard from In Ha that you came back.

397
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,020
Why didn't you call me?

398
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,410
I'm sorry. I was going to.

399
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,810
<i>Come to the house with In Ha for a meal.</i>

400
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,820
It's been too long since we last saw each other.

401
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:45,460
I miss you a lot.

402
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,920
<i>I'll see you at my house tomorrow.</i>

403
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,490
Yes.

404
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,180
After coming all the way here, why?

405
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,790
I'm not going.

406
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:12,020
Hurry, hurry.

407
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,490
Smile, smile.

408
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,630
Jeong, you came?

409
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:34,120
What's up with you two? It's been so long that you feel awkward, huh?

410
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,810
Let's all go inside. The chairman is probably waiting for us.

411
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,240
Ah, that bastard!

412
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:52,830
I don't know how long it's been since we've all been together.

413
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,200
I know. Jeong has been saying he's so busy that he never called or saw us.

414
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,180
Now that I can see him, I'm so, so happy.

415
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,810
In Ho, tell me about you.

416
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,050
What have you been up to?

417
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,830
Just this and that.

418
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,650
At least everyone has returned now.

419
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:19,100
If you ever need anything, tell me whenever.

420
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,890
Jeong, pay some attention to In Ho, too.

421
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,390
Yes.

422
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:29,940
Can't I live with you and Jeong forever like this? I like it so...

423
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,990
Be quiet.

424
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,910
Jeong, it's your vacation, isn't it?

425
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,220
Let's all go somewhere together during Jeong's vacation.

426
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,420
Have some of this too.

427
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,530
Sure, sure. Eat a lot.

428
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,990
Yes.

429
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:52,540
In Ho, I know you're upset with us.

430
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,480
The past is all done with. Now, start the piano again.

431
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,690
I don't have any interest in piano anymore.

432
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,260
So, you don't have to worry about me.

433
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,510
How can I not worry?

434
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,910
I'm still young and there's a lot I can do.

435
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:16,000
And I'm very thankful for you having taken care of us thus far.

436
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,060
- In Ho.<br> - I really don't need it.

437
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,470
And, it was good to see you today.

438
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:29,490
Okay, I got it.

439
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,380
Let's take some time to think about it.

440
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,190
I'll be going.

441
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:41,020
Oh, okay. I'll see you again.

442
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,720
You aren't going to take me home? I don't want to take the taxi.

443
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,130
Jeong, since it's been a long time, should the three of us hang out together?

444
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,830
Jeong, why are you so cold to me these days?

445
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:12,900
Are you like this because you don't know? How long are you going to live like this?

446
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,820
It seems like you're planning to live off my family forever.

447
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,870
Do you think that's possible?

448
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,960
- If you have a head, think a little. <br>- I don't want to.

449
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,820
This is all I can do.

450
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,210
Do you think I'll quit?

451
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,300
If you don't like it, then you do well.

452
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:33,110
If you're good to me, then everything will become more comfortable for you.

453
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,620
Think about it well.

454
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Go, Ahjussi.

455
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:55,950
I thought I'd never see you again. Why did you show up here?

456
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,790
Did I come because I wanted to? I came because he told me to come many times.

457
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,350
Your expression earlier was worth seeing.

458
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,230
You couldn't even show your dislike in front of your father.

459
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:13,530
What to do? Your father seems to be different from you.

460
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:18,030
Because his oh-so-successful son ruined a person's life,

461
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,480
- he must feel sorry.<br>- It's someone else's fault to the end, isn't it?

462
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,240
And it's my father's fault for rescuing you both from that awful place.

463
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,930
And it's my fault that happened to your hand.

464
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,970
But if you really want to find fault with someone,

465
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,810
shouldn't you fault yourself for disappearing when I was going to pay for your rehab?

466
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,470
Rehab?

467
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:41,900
- Can you dare to say "rehab" with that mouth?<br> - If you don't like it, take your sister who is mooching off my household

468
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,600
and disappear immediately.

469
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,020
What's so great about you that you look down on everybody! Huh?

470
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,530
Do you think everything in this world will turn out as you plan?

471
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:00,830
Seeing some poor children eating food off your family,

472
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,210
is it so mortifying and unfair?

473
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:05,620
Hit me. Hit me, you bastard.

474
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:09,110
Don't cowardly manipulate people from behind and just hit me.

475
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,260
Hit me now!

476
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,830
That's for the repair costs.

477
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,950
<i>Tomorrow is the presentation.</i>

478
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,590
<i>Why isn't anyone sending their materials?</i>

479
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:19,380
<i>Nobody is checking the messages. </i>

480
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:24,910
But they're logged into Facebook.

481
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,940
They're just not checking their personal messages?

482
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,360
Fine.

483
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,050
Just give up.

484
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,960
Hong Seol. Seol, get yourself together.

485
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,900
If you fail this time,

486
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,240
there's no scholarship, there's nothing.

487
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,390
What's the point in getting mad? Getting a good score is what's important.

488
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:28,010
I did it all!

489
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,700
I'll just sleep for an hour.

490
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,980
Presentation.

491
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,990
There's no reason they would know the contents of the presentation.

492
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,380
I have to do the presentation.

493
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,720
Seol, I'm really sorry.

494
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,200
My younger sibling broke my computer, and the repairman didn't come.

495
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,270
I took some medicine and fell asleep. I'm really sorry.

496
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,730
I drank so much I feel nauseous.

497
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,280
<i>I don't even want to bother answering them.</i>

498
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,750
Just memorize this quickly. I wrote out the presentation script.

499
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,070
- Wow, thanks. <br>- As I expected, Hoobae Hong.

500
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:35,690
- Hello. <br>- Hello.

501
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,590
You've all prepared, right?

502
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,270
I have high expectations.

503
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:43,890
Group one will present first. Group one, come out.

504
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,920
- Take care of us well! <br>- Surprised me.

505
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,340
Hello!

506
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:01,920
Our topic is LN Electric's strategy in the Chinese mobile phone market.

507
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:05,020
Group one's presentation

508
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,180
will start!

509
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,720
In today's Chinese market, LN Electric's smart phones

510
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,520
are in a deep slump.

511
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:20,070
That is our conclusion.

512
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,440
Don't move around too much.

513
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,460
Yes, I understand.

514
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:28,420
Looking at the presentation slides, I can tell they did their research.

515
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,790
He's quite the salesman.

516
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,900
Let's look into the background...

517
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,710
I'm Jeong Soo Yeon from Group 2.

518
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:38,440
I will start my presentation.

519
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,050
When an analysis of the profits for the last five years is performed,

520
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,640
not only in the volume of sales but also in hardware sales

521
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,550
you can see income gradually declining.

522
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:51,650
- Wait. Did she say something is declining? <br> - Yes.

523
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,750
I think your voice is declining.

524
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:56,210
- I can't understand what you're saying. <br>- Can you understand what she's saying?

525
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,390
- No. <br>- I can't understand. <br> - See?

526
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,170
- Say 'ah'. <br> - Ah. <br>- Ah!

527
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,000
Everything's the same.

528
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,050
No, say it louder. I can't understand anything.

529
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:09,880
Start again.

530
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,040
Why is that?

531
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,030
Why is sales volume declining?

532
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,770
Is there a problem with the product?

533
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,380
I think there's a problem.

534
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,430
Do you have indigestion?

535
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,710
You look depressed. Did you break up with a lover?

536
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,730
Here you go.

537
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,410
Our group will discuss Black Edition, who once swept the domestic markets with their MP3 players.

538
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,230
In order to succeed in the international markets

539
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,890
we will examine what direction they must take.

540
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,650
One of the features of Black Edition

541
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:45,100
is that they have superior sound quality.

542
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,500
Play it.

543
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,370
It appears to be broken.

544
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:58,790
<i>If everyone is like this, there is hope for us. </i>

545
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,070
Samjin Department Store, which was founded on the principle of putting customers first

546
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:04,180
adopted a strategy of targeting the mass market

547
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,880
and grew its domestic business.

548
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,960
They are tops in market shares value and sales.

549
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,940
But their profit margins are the lowest.

550
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,720
As expected, Yoo Jeong is doing so well. He does so well.

551
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,750
He's so cool.

552
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,700
For Samjin Department Stores, a change in strategy

553
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,230
is necessary.

554
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:25,290
This concludes Group 4's presentation.

555
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,550
Very nice. Very nice.

556
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:33,650
It was very clean. Good work. Go sit down.

557
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,120
Next, group five.

558
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,250
Group five's presentation will now start.

559
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,930
<i>Still, </i>

560
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:01,970
<i>because I did a decent job organizing,</i>

561
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,260
<i>It won't be an A+, but an A will be possible. </i>

562
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:08,490
<i>If everyone presents well. </i>

563
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:10,850
In 1996...

564
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,120
they entered the market in Johannesburg,

565
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,890
their main product was

566
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,200
Digital Home Machines,

567
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,640
commercial signs and middle...

568
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,060
and other products were sold.

569
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,910
Middle...

570
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,570
I meant that they didn't sell to the middle class, but they

571
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,590
sold to...

572
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,430
Since watching you earlier, you keep looking down at the printout.

573
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,610
- It appears you're not considering the audience's perspective.<br> - I'm sorry.

574
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,050
- What year are you?<br>- Third year.

575
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,070
If you're already a third year,

576
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,380
shouldn't you at least be aware of posture for a presentation, everyone?

577
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,030
That's right.

578
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:58,130
They say that's right.

579
00:40:58,130 --> 00:40:58,660
I'm sorry.

580
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,070
Are you going to do it again or not?

581
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:05,080
<i>We'll get at least a B, maybe?</i>

582
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:10,630
- I'll do it— I'm sorry. I'll do it again.<br>- No, no, no.

583
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,350
I think it's better not to do it again.

584
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:14,140
And the reason why, everyone,

585
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,590
I've been continuously observing you.

586
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:21,420
Right now, you don't seem to know the content of what you're presenting.

587
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:24,330
Did you actually research this?

588
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:28,950
Yes.

589
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,340
- Hong Seol. <br>- Yes.

590
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,950
Explain LN Electrics' strategy for the South African market.

591
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:39,140
The South African government has abolished tariffs in order to stimulate foreign trade...

592
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,590
- Behind, Sang Cheol.<br>- Yes?

593
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:44,680
She spoke of foreign trade and tariffs, right?

594
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,830
How are they related to each other?

595
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,750
Yes, that's...

596
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:50,480
I'll respond instead of him.

597
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,400
No, not you. You.

598
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,330
Yes, so... um, if the tariffs are gone

599
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,620
it will be advantageous to export, no I mean, import...

600
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,680
Behind, Da Yeong.

601
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,690
- So do they give or receive foreign investments? <br> - Yes.

602
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,030
- What? <br>- Yes?

603
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,840
What?

604
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,100
They receive it.

605
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,030
They don't receive it.

606
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,460
What is that?

607
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,820
<i>If it's like this, not a B, but a C? </i>

608
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,970
<i>C? A C? Does it make sense? </i>

609
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:26,990
Seeing this printout,

610
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,600
it's good. Neat. It's well-done.

611
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,430
But anyone can tell from just seeing this

612
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,110
that one person did all of this alone.

613
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:42,140
I definitely said this.

614
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,840
I definitely said not to get caught.

615
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:49,630
So for group five...

616
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:02,450
So for group five,

617
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,430
everyone get's a D.

618
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:09,680
Wow!

619
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,330
Daebak!

620
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,070
No exceptions.

621
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,160
Go sit down.

622
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,070
Professor.

623
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:20,890
Go sit down. Or go home.

624
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:29,600
Who keeps clapping from earlier?

625
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:35,140
I'll tell you. In the history of team projects,

626
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,160
this was the worst one.

627
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,570
Everyone.

628
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:41,980
I'm so disappointed.

629
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,520
I should just not talk.

630
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,220
We'll end class here.

631
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:51,050
You worked hard.

632
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:54,540
Hoobae Hong, I'm sorry.

633
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:58,620
Because the atmosphere was like that, my response wouldn't come out.

634
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,070
Hey, Min Soo, what's with the stammering?

635
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,250
I'm originally not the type to present.

636
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,480
Is everyone born ready to present?

637
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,640
No, do you have the right to say something to Min Soo?

638
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,210
How are you going to be responsible for us getting a D?

639
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:17,250
You didn't know the answer, either.

640
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,000
And you? You couldn't even reply.

641
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,790
I did.

642
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:25,050
Hoobae Hong. Let go of your anger.

643
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:28,470
If you go to school, you get D's too.

644
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:30,660
Let's think of it well, Hoobae Hong!

645
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,980
Seol, I'm sorry.

646
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,850
We were wrong. Let go of your anger.

647
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,820
I should have the one to present first.

648
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,340
Does it make a difference if you had presented first?

649
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,040
<i>She did her individual work. </i>

650
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:57,230
Really. She's acting like the world has fallen apart because she got a D.

651
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:02,020
I know. I told her that I was sick. She never lets it go.

652
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,110
- This is a real makjang (outrageous).<br> - Poor Hong.

653
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,470
What?

654
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:11,950
Still, a D for even me is...

655
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:16,620
I worked really hard.

656
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,040
You worked really hard alone.

657
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,940
But can't you see that's the biggest problem?

658
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,310
Seol. I've been watching you.

659
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:32,780
You consider yourself very sincere, don't you?

660
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:37,820
And so because the others couldn't do as well as you, you gave up on them and did it all yourself, didn't you?

661
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,250
That would have been more comfortable for you.

662
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:46,610
Up to now, I don't know if that's how you've been getting good grades.

663
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,790
But in real life, you can't do everything yourself.

664
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,740
And you're a Business Administration major. What is Business Administration?

665
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,400
Communication. Communication is everything.

666
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,710
Do you know what I mean?

667
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,310
Go on and leave. I said no exceptions.

668
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:19,070
<i>For the first time, I got a D.</i>

669
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:30,080
Did you do your presentation well?

670
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:34,640
Of course, for sure it's an A+. A+?

671
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,760
Is it not?

672
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,530
Anyway, it's because you were in the group, right?

673
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,950
You can just take the rest of your tests well. You're good at studying.

674
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:48,980
And when break comes, we can all go on trip together.

675
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,330
Eun Taek and I thought about it,

676
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:56,870
and what about Busan? We can go see the ocean and eat raw fish, right?

677
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:58,970
Do what you like.

678
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,580
Why? Do you not want to go to Busan?

679
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,880
It's not like that.

680
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,290
If you don't like the ocean,

681
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,730
then mountains? Mountains? How's Jiri Mountain?

682
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:10,800
If not, Mt. Nam close by is okay, too.

683
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,380
Bo Ra, do what you like.

684
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,100
It's enough after I've said it once. Stop it.

685
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:21,010
Hey. Why are you getting angry?

686
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,270
I was just talking about a trip.

687
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,860
I got a D from Professor Kang.

688
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:29,660
I don't think I can get a scholarship this time. It isn't the time to be talking about a trip.

689
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,950
Then you can just say that. Why are you getting angry?

690
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,090
You keep saying things vaguely, so I kept asking.

691
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:38,180
Is that a mistake?

692
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,410
You're always like this. You don't share any of your thoughts or say anything you need to say.

693
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:48,290
I can't go on a trip. I don't even have tuition money.

694
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,300
If you're having a hard time, then say you're having a hard time. Why are you making me the bad person?

695
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,430
It's a personal circumstance. Do I have to say that?

696
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:58,490
Nothing get's solved even if I tell you.

697
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:00,690
It's not that kind of problem.

698
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:05,580
You don't ever tell me any of your thoughts.

699
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,840
I'll go first.

700
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,450
Bo Ra.

701
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,990
Why do you two fight?

702
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:16,170
Are you okay?

703
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:22,300
Go to Bo Ra. Console her well.

704
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,110
<i>♫ I haven't been able to tell you yet. ♫</i>

705
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:49,790
<i>♫ When I see you, I ♫</i>

706
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:52,000
Seol.

707
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,310
<i>♫ As if nothing is wrong, ♫</i>

708
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:58,420
<i>♫ As if I don't care, ♫</i>

709
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,040
<i>♫ That's how I was. ♫</i>

710
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,580
<i>♫ But actually I hope you come. ♫</i>

711
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:18,230
<i>♫ I'm someone who withstood time. ♫</i>

712
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:23,530
<i>♫ The passing look in your eyes, ♫</i>

713
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:29,200
<i>♫ Your cold smile, ♫</i>

714
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,610
<i>♫ Often makes me lose my breath. ♫ </i>

715
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:51,440
Why is a girl's bag so heavy?

716
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,690
What are you?

717
00:49:53,690 --> 00:49:55,520
It's been a long time, Dog Fur.

718
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,120
When are you going to buy me a meal? You know you have two more times left.

719
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,210
Give it to me.

720
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:05,970
I'll carry it. While I'm escorting you.

721
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,950
Is there something wrong?

722
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:21,550
No.

723
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:25,420
Yeah right. It looks like something is wrong.

724
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,780
Your face looks old when something is wrong.

725
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:31,930
Excuse me.

726
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:37,750
<i>Everyone says I lived the wrong way.</i>

727
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:41,620
<i>What do I do at times like this? </i>

728
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,000
Why did you call me and not say anything?

729
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,950
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

730
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:52,790
See, see. She's totally going to dig herself into the ground.

731
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,140
I'm really not in the mood for this.

732
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,850
Cool off for now. I don't know what's wrong.

733
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:07,410
Cool off and just forget about it. It's harder for you if you hold onto it.

734
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:11,600
Here. When your depressed, sweets are the best.

735
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,010
I'm going.

736
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,290
Give me my bag before leaving.

737
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,040
Take it.

738
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,180
Baek In Ho. Baek In Ha.

739
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,140
Father, it's me.

740
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:15,260
I have something to tell you about In Ho and In Ha.

741
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,910
You do? What is it?

742
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:20,290
They aren't young anymore.

743
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:22,780
Instead of just supporting them without a plan,

744
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,560
I was thinking you should help them become able to stand on their own.

745
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:32,790
But In Ho doesn't want help.

746
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,570
You should start by standing In Ha up on her own.

747
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:38,570
What about bringing In Ha into the company?

748
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,120
I think either accounting or the IT department would be good.

749
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,620
Okay. That's a good thought.

750
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:48,010
If you consider only relevant certification, it seems she will earn her keep for the company, so it's not bad.

751
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:49,810
But will In Ha do it?

752
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,650
I'll figure that out on my own.

753
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:58,020
Okay. Since you're taking interest in them, it puts my mind at ease.

754
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:00,140
Because you've seen In Ho for the first time in a while,

755
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:02,300
get along well.

756
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,030
Yes, I understand.

757
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:24,450
<i>Oh, Jeong! What's up for you to actually be calling me?</i>

758
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,540
A Certificate? At a study academy?

759
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,500
You want me to take a class?

760
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,210
Jeong, why are you like this to me lately?

761
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,350
You know I can't stand that kind of thing!

762
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:39,640
You don't really think I'm going to do it, do you?

763
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,000
What do you mean, "of course?"

764
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,030
Hey. <i>What are you doing?</i>

765
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,760
- Listen well, Baek In Ha.<br><i>- Do you know how much my nails cost to get done?</i>

766
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,540
- This is the last chance I'm giving you.<br><i>- These are really expensive...</i>

767
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,300
<i>What are you doing, seriously!?</i>

768
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:08,010
Yeah. This is the right thing.

769
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,990
There's so much that went wrong.

770
00:54:41,770 --> 00:54:45,670
<i>So everyone in Group 5 gets a D.</i>

771
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:03,560
<i>I didn't have any room to turn and look to the side.</i>

772
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,820
<i>In order not to fail in front of him, </i>

773
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:13,290
<i>just looking forward, I thought I lived more earnestly than anyone else.</i>

774
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,740
Your two Americanos are ready.

775
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,050
<i>So you thought the others couldn't do as well as you, and gave up on them and did it all yourself, didn't you?</i>

776
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,750
<i>And that was more comfortable for you to do.</i>

777
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:30,460
<i>What in the world went wrong?</i>

778
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,960
<i>All of this wasn't anyone else's fault. It was my problem.</i>

779
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,790
Hey, Joo Mok, women

780
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:43,640
don't know this because they've never been to the army.

781
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:46,540
If one person makes a mistake,

782
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,170
everyone is supposed to get punished.

783
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,960
Just because we got a D.

784
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,760
Seriously, she's like a D. Like a D.

785
00:55:56,700 --> 00:56:00,190
<i>Everything was happening at once.</i>

786
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,890
Test?

787
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,540
Good luck.

788
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:15,150
<i>Where to even begin to set things straight,</i>

789
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:17,710
<i>I didn't even know where.</i>

790
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:58,010
<i>The only thing I can do, is to do what needs to be done now.</i>

791
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:05,880
Sunbae!

792
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:36,100
I'm sorry.

793
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:40,670
For arranging something without asking you first.

794
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,360
Even so, I'd like it if you didn't misunderstand me.

795
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:48,110
I didn't spend time with you because of Ah Yeong.

796
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:52,690
Once I got closer to you,

797
00:57:52,690 --> 00:57:55,470
I thought you were a good person,

798
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,820
so I set you up with her.

799
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,950
I'm really sorry if I hurt your feelings.

800
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:06,710
I'm sorry too.

801
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,840
To be honest, I was really acting like a child.

802
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:16,220
I was embarrassed and a little frustrated.

803
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:19,840
<i>Frustrated over what?</i>

804
00:58:21,890 --> 00:58:26,050
Let's forget anything we felt upset about at each other.

805
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,820
Yes.

806
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,950
Um, Sunbae, if you have time tonight,

807
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:40,820
could I buy you dinner?

808
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,950
I mean, because last time, we didn't eat properly. So this time, properly,

809
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,070
something expensive.

810
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:52,340
How much?

811
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,540
How much?

812
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,730
How much are you thinking?

813
00:59:05,230 --> 00:59:07,160
Then, Sunbae, you decide.

814
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:11,950
<i>♫ Call me back to set me straight. ♫</i>

815
00:59:11,950 --> 00:59:16,700
<i>♫ Give me your hand so I can understand. ♫</i>

816
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,340
<i>♫ What more do I have to say? ♫</i>

817
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:25,930
<i>♫ Just believe in what you see. ♫</i>

818
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,080
- I'm good now, right?<br> -Yes. Yeah, yeah!

819
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,020
You're really good. Opening that is tough.

820
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:34,970
I practiced a whole lot.

821
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:41,990
Here.

822
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:08,140
I just think it's a relief we made up.

823
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,000
It was pretty uncomfortable.

824
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,850
It was that way for me too.

825
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,210
I didn't think it was.

826
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:17,660
I acted like it wasn't.

827
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,900
<i>Be careful of that bastard, Yoo Jeong.</i>

828
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,070
<i>He's not all what he seems.</i>

829
01:00:24,070 --> 01:00:28,450
Sunbae, by any chance, do you know Baek In Ho?

830
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:35,010
Tall, slightly rough in his manner of speech and well packaged.

831
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:40,070
How do you know him?

832
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:43,160
A while back, I lost my phone.

833
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:45,400
He found it for me.

834
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,590
It seemed like he really knew you.

835
01:00:48,590 --> 01:00:51,520
If you run into him again, just ignore him.

836
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,920
From now on, don't be close with him.

837
01:00:55,330 --> 01:00:59,870
Okay. <i>For some reason, I felt like I shouldn't ask anything more.</i>

838
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:03,860
But, this neighborhood is dark. It must be dangerous for women to be alone.

839
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,000
From now on, I'll take you home.

840
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,210
Oh, no, no. It's okay.

841
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,550
Thank you for walking me home. We're here.

842
01:01:19,650 --> 01:01:22,530
Thank you for dropping me off.

843
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:30,300
Then, goodbye.

844
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,430
Seol.

845
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:41,190
Yes?

846
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,040
Want to go out with me?

847
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:56,970
♫ <i>Love is really loving</i> ♫

848
01:01:58,730 --> 01:02:08,050
♫ <i>If I said I miss you</i> ♫

849
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:12,060
♫ <i>I will try</i> ♫

850
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:18,210
♫ <i>To be where I belong</i> ♫

851
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:24,360
♫ <i>Because there's nothing in the world</i> ♫

852
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,540
<i>Sunbae, I don't know why you're saying this to me.</i>

853
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,390
<i>- You really don't know?<br> - I'm sorry.</i>

854
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,020
<i>Why are you at school during vacation?</i>

855
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,200
<i>To see Seol for a minute. You didn't miss me? I missed you.</i>

856
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,150
<i>I'm going to come here often. Should we go on a date?</i>

857
01:02:37,150 --> 01:02:40,090
<i>Makes no sense. It's unbelievable. It doesn't seem real.</i>

858
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:43,620
<i>But what does Yoo Jeong find so charming about Hong Noona to do that?</i>

859
01:02:43,620 --> 01:02:45,640
<i>It's not fancy, it's granny.</i>

860
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:47,770
<i>But does she know what kind of bastard you are?</i>

861
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:50,600
<i>- A fox-like wench to Yoo Jeong.<br>- Good job!</i>

862
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,150
<i>I warned you not to idle around her.</i>

863
01:02:53,150 --> 01:02:54,580
<i>Dog Hair.</i>

864
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,480
<i>But what can be done? I don't have a dying thought of going back as you want me to.</i>

865
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,110
<i>I told you to avoid him. Do as I say.</i>

866
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:02,760
<i>Later if you get stabbed in the back and cry, I won't help you.</i>

867
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,960
<i>Why exactly did Sunbae ask me to date?</i>

868
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,110
<i>Sunbae, wait a minute!</i>

869
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:16,020
