00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,190
Why isn't Hong Joon answering his phone?

10
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,010
I'm from the moving company.

11
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,470
Pardon?

12
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,140
The moving company.

13
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,190
Did Joon call them?

14
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,150
- Hi! <br> - What is this?

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,050
What? You finished packing already? You should've asked us to help you.

16
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,410
Also...

17
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,450
- We brought him here. <br> - Sunbae.

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,880
You put your boyfriend to work at times like these.

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,380
Sunbae, is this the first time you've visited Seol's place?

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,250
It seems like he's been here a couple of times already...

21
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,410
He hasn't.

22
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:26,820
It looks like we only have to move those. Let's eat first and then do it.

23
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,580
Yeah, let's go eat first. It's the first time the four of us met like this. How about some meat at the shop up there?

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,080
- Meat. <br> - I got it. I'll finish up and go.

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,920
Finish what up? Just hurry and come with us.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,860
Okay, okay.

27
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,570
Let's go!

<i>Episode 7</i>

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,640
- I hate egg rolls the most in this world. <br> - Still, it's the first place I lived alone in.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,980
I feel sad since I'm about to leave.

31
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,900
I'm going to be farther away from you and Bo Ra, too.

32
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,760
- I guess... <br> - Noona!

33
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,160
Dog Fur!

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,810
You... You.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,110
You said that you were going to come in the morning. Why are you late?

36
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,070
Why are you guys together?

37
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,240
I met him on the way here.

38
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,510
Did you drink? Are you out of your mind?

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,470
Hong! Who is he?

40
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,220
He's my brother and he's... I mean, this person is...

41
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,500
I was a teacher at an academy she went toâ€” I resigned. I'm Baek In Ho.

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,820
Hello, I'm Seol's friend.

43
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,930
- Look at you. <br>- <i>What?</i>

44
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,440
- Hey! Go and pack now. <br> - What are you talking about?

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,180
What am I talking about? I'm telling you to hurry and go pack now!

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:49,850
- How am I supposed to know what to pack? <br> - You said that you'd pack for me! Do you want to get hit?

47
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,290
Seol, let's just go eat together.

48
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,650
- But, Sunbae... <br> - He's right, let's go and eat together.

49
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's go.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,230
- Let's do that. <br> - Let's go.

51
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,770
What are you doing?

52
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,960
Oh, the last time I went to your place, it seemed really far.

53
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,700
It'll be hard on you when you move.

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,030
I can't do anything about it.

55
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,610
- You went to her house? <br> - Yeah, I went and got to eat hamburgers there.

56
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,670
- What? When did you go to her house without me? <br> - You weren't there last time.

57
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,350
I told you before that I sent her home because Sunbae Yeong Geun followed her like a stalker.

58
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,350
That pathetic bastard?

59
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,870
Hey, what kind of guy follows you from the academy to your house?

60
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,890
He made such a fuss in front of the academy last time, too.

61
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,140
What's up with you? Why do other guys have to guard your girlfriend?

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,320
Why didn't you tell me?

63
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,580
That is... It wasn't anything important. It's just that

64
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,230
he always went around talking about weird things.

65
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,240
Tell me next time, okay?

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay.

67
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,580
- Have some. <br> - Sunbae seems to take care of you well.

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,820
He's definitely your boyfriend. Boyfriend.

69
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,900
Anyhow, what

70
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,830
kind of part-time job looks at your background? Are they telling middle school students to go and die or what?

71
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,010
Middle schooler? Are you a middle schooler?

72
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,010
- I mean middle school graduate. <br> - A middle school graduate? <br> - That's right, punk.

73
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,000
Are you also looking for a part-time job? I also have to look for one. It's hard looking for one, isn't it?

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,210
- It's hard. <br>- Our shop is looking to hire, though. Who wants a job?

75
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,380
- Me! <br> - Me.

76
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:35,830
You said that it was too far away.

77
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,200
It is kind of far... You can have the job.

78
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,430
-Where is it? What am I going to be doing?<br>-It's on the way to Gyeong jong.

79
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:45,070
Joon. Don't do it.

80
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,110
It's on the way to Gyeong jong. The shop is really small. We don't get customers.

81
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,150
- Is that so? <br> - Yeah.

82
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,100
- It sounds good. I want to do it. <br> - Do you want to ruin the business from the start?

83
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,200
Plus, it's Mom who's hiring. What do you think you're doing?

84
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,080
- That could happen... <br> - That punk is seriously...

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,680
It's fine. There's nothing you can do.

86
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,080
- It's fine. Don't feel defeated.<br> - Don't worry about it.

87
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,020
I'll go. Call.

88
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,000
Right, I heard that the crazy pervert still hasn't been caught yet.

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,330
I heard that he went from our school's back gate to this neighborhood.

90
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,410
That pervert is the grand thief of underwear.

91
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,890
What? Does he make knives out of underwear?

92
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,390
- That isn't even funny. <br> - Where do they sell jokes like that...

93
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,240
You must have learned jokes from books.

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,700
Hey Daedo means big knife.

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,340
It's great that you get to move without encountering the pervert.

96
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,660
Yeah, what a relief.

97
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,770
It takes 4 hours to commute to school. It's going to be hard on you, Seol.

98
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,450
Here, here. To Seol's 4 hours of commute, cheers!

99
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:48,670
- Cheers! <br> - Cheers!

100
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,550
Is this something to be cheering for?

101
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,250
Cheers!

102
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,020
Sorry, Dog Fur.

103
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,470
- Give that to me. <br> - I'm fine.

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,460
Hong, it's your last night here. Let's have a sleepover.

105
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,430
- I still have to pack. <br> - We'll help you.

106
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,190
- Not today. <br> - Hong!

107
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,160
- Let's have a sleepover at your place next time. <br> - We'll go to the convenience store and buy some snacks, beer, and hot dogs.

108
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,170
- We'll buy it all! <br> - I really can't tonight.

109
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:42,510
- Let's go. <br> - We'll come back! <br> - Next time...

110
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,750
I have to pack, though.

111
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,660
Are you all going to come?

112
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,940
Of course.

113
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,010
I have to clean up my room, so come slowly.

114
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,960
Joon, take your time with them.

115
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,220
Just do as you've always done. Why do you care so much about it when you're about to move out?

116
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,350
Up until when are you going to follow us?

117
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,090
Soon she'll be my boss's child, so I should go help.

118
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:21,870
Don't worry, don't worry. I'm going to move to a new neighborhood and take it over.

119
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,260
If the pathetic bastard comes to the noodle shop or

120
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:28,200
to her house, I'll take care of him for you guys. Okay?

121
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:32,770
It's going to be fun with you part-timing at the shop. Hyung, my momâ€”

122
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:35,360
I'm going first.

123
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,030
Why are you so late? I waited for you.

124
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,330
Where are you going? I've been watching you all this time and

125
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,890
you were the source of dirtiness.

126
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,360
You invite men into your room, and the pervert next door too.

127
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,790
Do your parents know that you live like this?

128
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,480
You are annoying me.

129
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,520
Who are you?

130
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,740
Let go of her.

131
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:20,290
Okay.

132
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,760
Here. Take her.

133
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,470
Seol. Are you okay? Seol, Seol.

134
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,750
Catch that bastard!

135
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:49,140
That! That brick bastard!

136
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,900
Hong! Are you okay?

137
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,000
Seriously...

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,920
Should I call the ambulance?

139
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,890
- Oh Joon, it's me. <br> - Is my sister fine?

140
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,950
- She got a bit hurt. <br> - How hurt is she?

141
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,530
- That son of a bi*ch! <br> - Hey, did Dog Fur get hurt?

142
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,320
Yes.

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,690
He's dead when I catch him.

144
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:30,420
We ran everywhere, but we weren't able to find him.

145
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,000
I got it. I'll head over there.

146
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,710
Bora and Eun Taek will take care of you. I'll be back.

147
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,360
Don't go.

148
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,590
Go to the hospital first. Take care of her.

149
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:45,350
Be careful, Sunbae.

150
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,650
Where is the brick bastard?!

151
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,000
You are hiding well, aren't you?

152
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,110
Ahh, this punk...

153
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,980
So he's hidden himself well, like a rat.

154
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,990
Stay where you're hiding, you bastard!

155
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:21,420
You're dead, you bastard! You brick-like bastard!

156
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
Now they've all received their punishments.

157
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm going to have to leave now.

158
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,070
So you were here.

159
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,320
Let go of me!

160
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,930
My head! My head!

161
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,790
How can these students catch a criminal? Hurry and tell them to come back.

162
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,350
- They're not answering their phones. <br> - Student, you seem really hurt. We have to rush you to the hospital.

163
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,340
Please help.

164
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,910
I'll head out, too.

165
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,690
- Be careful. <br> - Help me out.

166
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,460
So Seol wasn't mistaken when she saw you the other day.

167
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,360
I just don't understand

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,760
why people like you are living in this society.

169
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,760
It suits you well.

170
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,950
Does it hurt? It's exactly what you did to Seol earlier.

171
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,800
Does she know that you're doing this?

172
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,180
Does she know how crazy you are?

173
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:03,690
She knows. She's similar to me.

174
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:09,870
Yeah right. Take a look at what you've done to me.

175
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:12,490
She probably wouldn't even understand this.

176
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,160
People like her can't understand people like us.

177
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,660
How are you different from me?

178
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,090
I should've parked my car on the main road. I had to report to work.

179
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,330
Hey don't come!

180
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,560
Don't come ssi!

181
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,920
Officer Park, this way! Hurry!

182
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,530
- Be careful, be careful. <br> - <i>I'm not the criminal!</i>

183
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,160
Don't go anywhere and stay here. The both of you.

184
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,070
Okay, okay.

185
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:40,400
But wasn't that the voice of Baek or whatever his name is?

186
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,690
Hurry and explain it to them.

187
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,820
Will you be fine?

188
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,670
- I'll be fine. <br> - Wait for me.

189
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,800
Ahjusshi!

190
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,160
Where did Sunbae go?

191
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:07,280
Wait, wait, wait.

192
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,730
Should I tell you something? There'll be no one by your side in the future.

193
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:20,430
There's definitely going to be a day where that girl is going to turn her back on you.

194
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,660
It hurts, it hurts.

195
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:40,580
They're only used to steal underwear. Should just I break them?

196
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,610
<i>Yoo Jung... did this to my hand.</i>

197
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,530
Seol.

198
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,850
Why are you alone? Where are they?

199
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,240
Sunbae...

200
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,540
Noona!

201
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,840
Noona! Noona, are you okay?

202
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,280
Is everything okay?

203
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,910
Geez...

204
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,700
He's here!

205
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,160
Get up for a second.

206
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,050
Can you get up?

207
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,370
Get on my back first.

208
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,740
Hyung, I'll go to the hospital first.

209
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:07,890
<i>Thankfully, Sunbae was able to get out of the police station without any problems.</i>

210
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,440
<i>And that person was not the grandson of the landlady.</i>

211
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,070
<i>Sexual assault, burglary.</i>

212
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,710
<i>He was the owner of a fake travel agency.</i>

213
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,070
<i>He swindled the landlord on a vacation package.</i>

214
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,140
<i>And the landlord is being delayed coming home from this problem.</i>

215
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,000
What's so strange about me?

216
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,630
Honestly the girls are causing more problems coming on to the guys and inviting men to their places.

217
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,780
Plus, honestly, what is normal these days? Take a look outside.

218
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,710
There are stranger people out there in the world. Am I not correct?

219
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,570
No you're not. No you're not.

220
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,000
He is a deviant and quite delusional.

221
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,640
He could get punished lightly if the test result shows he has a mental illness.

222
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,060
A punk like him needs to go to prison!

223
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,630
Then the main suspect is released, right?

224
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,930
Ahh yeah. The culprit admitted that case too.

225
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,860
He said he put the underwear in Gong Joo Yong's room.

226
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,940
Then...

227
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,450
Yeah. Goodbye.

228
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:17,400
It's not like I was seriously injured. You didn't have to visit me...

229
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,060
There. You said you know the person who helped me, right?

230
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,790
Yes.

231
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,420
Please give this to the person.

232
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:32,060
And this is yours. Take it.

233
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,420
Thank you.

234
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,050
Don't come to work from tomorrow. You only have two days left anyway.

235
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,030
I don't think you need to come to work. I am off.

236
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,210
Thank you.

237
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:54,090
But that model student sunbae was still waiting.

238
00:16:55,010 --> 00:17:02,000
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ viki. com </i>

239
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:25,140
My bones are fine.

240
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,040
Walking is alright as long as I don't run.

241
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,560
Right.

242
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,460
That's a relief.

243
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,260
Thanks for yesterday.

244
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,260
But from now on,

245
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,720
I don't want you to go to that extent.

246
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:55,200
I am regretting it now too.

247
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:03,240
<i>Okay. He did it because of me.</i>

248
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,170
<i>So that's okay.</i>

249
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,750
Summer vacation is almost over now.

250
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,400
Help me out on the second semester too, Sunbae.

251
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,050
Okay, me too.

252
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:23,380
<i>Now the end of my school life with Sunbae is beginning.</i>

253
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:32,390
<i>I don't know what'll happen in the future, but</i>

254
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,570
<i>wouldn't it better since I am with Sunbae?</i>

255
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,520
<i>Better my butt! Ahh I forgot about this.</i>

256
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,380
<i>The four-hour commute!</i>

257
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,030
Hong!

258
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,590
What is this? You came alone?

259
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,440
Why did you come alone?

260
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,580
<i>No one knows I am dating Sunbae...</i>

261
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,310
I'll get grace C.

262
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,590
<i>Only if these two will keep their mouths shut...</i>

263
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:08,350
Seol, hi!

264
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,180
I am Min Soo. Song Min Soo.

265
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,380
I look a bit weird without the glasses, aren't I?

266
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,950
No. You've gotten prettier.

267
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,960
Really? Thanks, you too.

268
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,980
Ah, but you were pretty to begin with...

269
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:41,930
- Were you well during the summer vacation? <br> - Yes

270
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,170
You were well too, right?

271
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,470
Your style got very similar to Hong now.

272
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,290
I always liked that style too.

273
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,780
I guess Seol and I have similar taste.

274
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,570
Taste...? Right your taste naturally was---

275
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,620
Right it was, right?

276
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,480
What are you writing?

277
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,050
Seol!

278
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,850
Sunbae! Welcome! I'll move.

279
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,680
- Hello. <br> - Scoot over.

280
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,430
You guys must have gotten a lot closer during the vacation.

281
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,510
No. There isn't any other seat open.

282
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,350
- We are dating. <br> - Huh? <br> - Dating?

283
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,580
You are dating Seol?

284
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,170
<i>I am ruined.</i>

285
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,140
Don't you remember?

286
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,190
What were you doing?

287
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,240
You surprised me because you blurted it out so suddenly...

288
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,190
It isn't something to hide either, is it?

289
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,430
So those two are really dating, huh?

290
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,840
This is dumbfounding...

291
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,590
That is true, but I can't get used it.

292
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,970
Then get used to it quickly.

293
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,820
- And you keep holding my hand in front of the other kids--- <br> - What is wrong about it?

294
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,920
I want to show off.

295
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:25,060
Are you the only couple? I am dating too.

296
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:30,770
Noona, Noona! Noona, Noona!

297
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,530
Oh Yeong Gon must have re-enrolled.

298
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,980
I am saying I'll carry these! Hurry up, Noona!

299
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,570
I am starting my internship next week, so I won't be able to see you often.

300
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,680
Tell me right away if Oh Yeong Gon does something weird to you, okay?

301
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:51,980
Intern? Did you get into Taerang Group?

302
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,830
That's awesome.

303
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,480
It's just an internship.

304
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,850
That's something though. It's very hard to get an internship there.

305
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,090
- Is that right? <br> - You are indeed...

306
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:07,480
Hello! I am your daughter's friend, Baek In Ho.

307
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,550
Are you really my daughter's friend?

308
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,590
Of course. I am very close with your daughter.

309
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,690
He was an English instructor at Noona's academy.

310
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,650
If foreign customers come, let him take care of them.

311
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,350
So why is an academy instructor here?

312
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,500
I have multiple reasons, but when it comes to strength,

313
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,770
I can be better than anyone. Try me, Boss!

314
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,830
I am the boss here.

315
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,160
Though you look strong...

316
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:38,710
First,

317
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,280
let's start with the cleaning.

318
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,600
You help too.

319
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,520
Using two mops get the job done faster.

320
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,470
Then I am...

321
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,200
Hey where are you going? Hold this.

322
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,550
Start mopping, hurry.

323
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:06,000
This work is quite hard. No time for a break all day.

324
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,300
You are wearing an apron.

325
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,470
I suits you well.

326
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,710
How can I look good even wearing this? I am so cool.

327
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,550
You just wait and see. I'll raise this shop's revenue.

328
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,630
- Aren't you embarrassed to say things like that? <br> - Not at all.

329
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,370
Being born with this beauty is something to boast about.

330
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,030
You came Noona. Awesome.

331
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,690
It is too hard. I am passing the baton. I am off first, Hyung.

332
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,430
Come here. Where do you think you are going?

333
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,530
Let me rest a bit, Hyung.

334
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:47,270
Are you kidding me? If you are resting,

335
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,060
your parents have to do it all. Get in!

336
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,540
- It's really too hard for me. <br> - Get in!

337
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,490
He met his match.

338
00:23:56,490 --> 00:23:58,650
Put those green onions in the refrigerator.

339
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,940
- I am back! <br> - Yeah!

340
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:05,120
Did the business do well?

341
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,660
Is that man really your friend?

342
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:18,390
Come on out to sweep.

343
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,520
He is not your boyfriend, is he?

344
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,350
No. My boyfriend is a school sunbae.

345
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,770
If he is your sunbae, he must be a senior. Where is he getting a job?

346
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,390
I don't know about that.

347
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,710
You don't even know that about your boyfriend?

348
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,350
No plans for the future,

349
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:45,630
and no hopes for future, that type of punk

350
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,440
will never do, understand?

351
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:51,520
A guy obsessed with business will never do either.

352
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,100
This person is seriously...

353
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,400
I'll go home first, so wrap it up before you come home.

354
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,150
Of course you'll do fine, but

355
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,780
you must really

356
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,890
pick the man carefully, okay?

357
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Just look at how I'm living...

358
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,720
<i>Right, I have been a bit indifferent.</i>

359
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,570
<i>Sunbae must be worried about his permanent employment, too...</i>

360
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,710
<i>But he doesn't express his worries though...</i>

361
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,990
<i>Anyway, where would I apply for my job?</i>

362
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:34,610
<i>Marriage...</i>

363
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,220
<i>About when would I do that?</i>

364
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,480
<i>Or with whom...?</i>

365
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,670
<i>With Sunbae?</i>

366
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,940
What am I thinking about?

367
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:58,970
Ah I am overdoing it...

368
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:03,030
That girlfriend is in my major

369
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:05,800
and is quite something.

370
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:10,460
They are like two peas in a pod---

371
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,560
If they were going end up together,

372
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,440
then why did Yoo Jeong put us together like that?

373
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:20,610
I can play with people too.

374
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,270
You just wait and see. If you take me as the old Oh Yeong Gon,

375
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,750
you guys will pee in your pants.

376
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:29,650
I am Oh Yeong Gon!

377
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,490
You won't eat with us now that you have a boyfriend.

378
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,870
This is how the friendship will crack. I've seen it many times.

379
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,440
Then. Shall we eat together with Sunbae?

380
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,550
- We'll eat just the two of us. <br> - But why? <br> - Hey Hong Seol!

381
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,800
You are quite capable.

382
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,320
Why are you suddenly trying to pick a fight again?

383
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,790
I didn't believe it, but you guys are really dating.

384
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:56,080
- I warned--- <br> - Stop it already.

385
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,890
Hey! If you keep this up,

386
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,050
I'll reveal everything you did to me.

387
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:06,530
Okay do that.

388
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,300
But do you know who'll be injured the most?

389
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:15,130
You just wait a bit. I'll let you know for sure what kind of punk your boyfriend really is.

390
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:19,150
- What shall we eat today? Pork belly? <br> - Meat again?

391
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:22,320
<i>The time that my ill fate started with Oh Yeong Gon</i>

392
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,280
<i>was definitely from that time.</i>

393
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:32,000
<i> During the time that sunbae kept on antagonizing me and</i>

394
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:35,160
<i>- I was having such difficult time because of it. <br> - They are going to give the money to the winning team.</i>

395
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,200
<i>Shall we cheer them to win so we can eat tasty food?</i>

396
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,910
<i>Let's start! Business major is the best! Great job!</i>

397
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:45,420
<i>Kwan Eun Taek! Kwan Eun Taek!</i>

398
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,770
<i>Trust me! Trust Oppa once!</i>

399
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,790
<i>Trust Oppa once! Oppa is here.</i>

400
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:56,200
<i>- What is this? <br> - Bo Ra!</i>

401
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:00,070
<i>Forget about Kwan Eun Taek. I'll bring the victory for you.</i>

402
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,500
<i>Oppa is charging!</i>

403
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,140
<i>Why is he like that to you? Wasn't he after Nam Joo Yeon?</i>

404
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,180
<i>He is like that anyway. It's annoying to take his crap already.</i>

405
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,950
<i>- Jeong is playing today. <br> - You can't do that.</i>

406
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:18,150
<i>$200 is on the line, so a good player should play.</i>

407
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,840
<i>Plus our major department's pride is on the line as well.</i>

408
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,650
<i>Then why is Jae Woo playing when he is not even 170cm tall?</i>

409
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:27,060
<i>Fine, fine, fine.</i>

410
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:30,630
<i>In return you eat everything you want to eat when we win.</i>

411
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,640
<i>Shh! We'll do everything. We have Jeong.</i>

412
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,850
<i>Give it to Jeong. Shoot!</i>

413
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,900
<i>Did you see that?!</i>

414
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:09,460
<i> Wow! Kwan Eun Taek is the best!</i>

415
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,840
<i>Let's have a chat.</i>

416
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,370
<i>Talk about what?</i>

417
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,200
<i> - Just come here. <br> - Let go of this and talk! Are you crazy?</i>

418
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,100
<i>- Just come here. I have something to tell you! <br> - That hurts!</i>

419
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,900
<i>- What's with you? <br> - Can't you see the game has started?!</i>

420
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,790
<i>And I don't like you!</i>

421
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,120
<i>Let go of that hand!</i>

422
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,790
<i>Just stop it already.</i>

423
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,640
<i>Hey what if I don't stop it?! Then what?</i>

424
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,040
<i>What do you think I'll do?</i>

425
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,510
<i>Look like you are about to hit me!</i>

426
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:42,310
<i>Uhh you grabbed me!</i>

427
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,410
<i>Go ahead and hit me! I am your sunbae!</i>

428
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,390
<i>Let go of me!</i>

429
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,460
<i>Just stop it.</i>

430
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,330
<i>What the hell?!</i>

431
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>Hey are you crazy? Why hit people, and Jeong at that?!</i>

432
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,760
<i>I got hit too! I am bleeding!</i>

433
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,130
<i>He is not bleeding, is he? What are you going to do about this?</i>

434
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:04,200
<i>You are too, Sunbae. This little... Are you okay?</i>

435
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,600
<i>I am okay. He didn't do it on purpose anyway.</i>

436
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,820
<i>You should go to the hospital.</i>

437
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,890
<i>What is he saying? Pretending you are nice with this hypocritical image...</i>

438
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,040
<i>You don't think I know all of your images?</i>

439
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:20,090
<i>Seriously is he crazy?</i>

440
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:25,700
<i>Hey! Just wake up. Do you think this sunbae is even interested in you guys?</i>

441
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,670
<i>Not at all. He is being nice to you because he pities you guys.</i>

442
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,780
<i>He is a fake. Can't you see?!</i>

443
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:35,080
<i>You are ignorant.</i>

444
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,560
<i>You guys can't even tell what's fake.</i>

445
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,200
<i>I am telling you he is faking it.</i>

446
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,930
<i>You are more fake.</i>

447
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,000
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

448
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,180
<i>Hey. It's not looking good for you, so hurry and apologize.</i>

449
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,350
<i>I am telling you to apologize. Get a hold of yourself!</i>

450
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:04,880
<i>Ahh okay. Sunbae t-that's a misunderstanding. I just blurted it out because I was angry.</i>

451
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,210
<i>I am really okay, so take care of your wound.</i>

452
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:11,010
<i>Ahh Sunbae, I am sorry. You are angry, right? Please forgive me.</i>

453
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,030
<i>- Hey! You pay for the meals! <br> - Ah. really! </i>

454
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:31,680
<i>He looks pitiful like that. Honestly not everything Yeong Gon said was wrong.</i>

455
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,950
<i>Are you alright?</i>

456
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,040
<i>But you were too much earlier. Make sure you apologize to Bo Ra later, okay?</i>

457
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,400
<i>Hey, the reason girls don't like you is</i>

458
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,650
<i>that you don't show your true feelings.</i>

459
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:18,490
<i>Don't do like you did earlier. Take you time and slowly</i>

460
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,810
<i>approach her. What do you think?</i>

461
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,330
<i>Drink this.</i>

462
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,770
<i>I should not have comforted someone casually.</i>

463
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:47,660
<i>After that day, Oh Yeong Gon started his obsession with me</i>

464
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,680
<i>and progressed more and more.</i>

465
00:32:57,630 --> 00:33:00,990
<i>What's wrong? Did I scare you?</i>

466
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:05,620
<i>Of course you scared me. What are you doing in front of my house?</i>

467
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:08,980
<i>Ahh, I came to see my friend here and I am on my way back.</i>

468
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,000
<i>Ahh, you live here too. Let's go. I'll take you home.</i>

469
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,430
<i>Hey! I am fine.</i>

470
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:21,220
<i>You told me to show my true feelings. I truly like you.</i>

471
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,330
<i>So why are you ignoring my feelings?</i>

472
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,750
<i>Hey. You know I didn't mean it that way.</i>

473
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:29,200
<i>And I don't like you!</i>

474
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,910
<i>Don't like me, my butt. You are just playing hard to get, right?</i>

475
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:41,550
<i>Don't be that way. You are making my heart flutter. Where are you going?</i>

476
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,270
<i>This is really creepy.</i>

477
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,740
<i>Hey! I told you not to send me presents, didn't I?!</i>

478
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,930
<i>Why? Don't you like it? That isn't a cheap thing.</i>

479
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,160
<i>-That is not the problem, is it? <br> - Why are you so mad?</i>

480
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,090
<i>Don't call again either!</i>

481
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:10,430
<i>Sunbae Yoo Jeong told me that you'd go crazy if I buy you something expensive.</i>

482
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:18,070
<i>I need to do some exercise. My belly is too big.</i>

483
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:24,790
<i>Hello. I have something to ask you Sunbae.</i>

484
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:29,500
<i>Oh Yeong Gon told me that you told him I liked him.</i>

485
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,480
<i>Thanks to you I've been suffering because he's been bothering me.</i>

486
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,440
<i>That punk is a funny punk.</i>

487
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,930
<i>You know Yeong Gon hit Jeong at the basketball match before,</i>

488
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:43,010
<i>and he was bothering Jeong claiming that he wanted to apologize, right?</i>

489
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:47,640
<i>He also said Seol is the only one who cares about him in our major.</i>

490
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,170
<i>So he just conversed with him once. That's all.</i>

491
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,640
<i>That punk really is trashy.</i>

492
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,050
<i>I am sorry anyway. I didn't mean it that way.</i>

493
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:05,310
<i>So because of Oh Yeong Gon's problem, what you said lightly had became like this?</i>

494
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,500
<i>Because of Oh Yeong Gon's problem.</i>

495
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,690
<i>Right. That punk is the problem.</i>

496
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,710
<i>I am sorry.</i>

497
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:19,250
<i>For some reason Oh Yeong Gon disappeared suddenly after that day.</i>

498
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:25,850
<i>and I had to close that case like that even though I felt uneasy about it.</i>

499
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:32,970
<i>Right. What is there to be uneasy about? Oh Yeong Gon probably made that story up anyway.</i>

500
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,990
<i>That's right. It probably is...</i>

501
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,370
Sunbae!

502
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,180
What's the big deal. The rumor has spread already.

503
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,430
It maybe alright for you, but it's not for me.

504
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,710
People I've never seen before come to me and ask me if I am dating you.

505
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:54,480
Then they check me out from top to bottom, making me feel bad.

506
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,880
They can't believe I am dating you and look at me like there's no way.

507
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,290
This sort of expression.

508
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,910
Don't laugh. I am serious.

509
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:12,080
I should buy sunglasses. I can't hold my head up because I am so famous now.

510
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,040
Uncle. If we don't make it with this shop, we won't be able to make a living this time.

511
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,720
Just how long is he going to wait for that one shot.

512
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,380
Don't worry too much.

513
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,620
Hyung will probably buckle down soon. I'll talk to him.

514
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,970
Please do.

515
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:32,570
Yeah.

516
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,800
Is he a new part timer?

517
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah.

518
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,650
He seems to be strong.

519
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,490
He is strong and Joon is completely under his control.

520
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,380
That's good. My cafe is doing remodeling now

521
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,500
and I need to take care of the construction trash. Is it okay if I use him for a short while?

522
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,560
Of course I'll pay him separately.

523
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,190
In Ho! This is Seol's uncle and he needs someone to clean up his shop. Can you do it?

524
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,800
He'll pay you separately.

525
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,070
Is that right? I'd like that.

526
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,410
Let's take a break.

527
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:18,530
Thank you.

528
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,860
Wow, you did a lot. Great job! Isn't it refreshing?

529
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,710
Yeah.

530
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:29,180
Next is the storage room. It's over there. Would you organize it?

531
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,720
Storage room?

532
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,590
Yeah.

533
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,120
Wow this is big.

534
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,030
This is quite big.

535
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,980
<i>Where did you find a youngster like that? You must be feeling great.</i>

536
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:32,300
<i>If he corrects his colt-like personality, he can be great.</i>

537
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,490
â™« <i> My man who looks great in uniform â™«</i>

538
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,910
â™« <i>Even if he doesn't put mousse on his hair â™«</i>

539
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:52,220
â™« <i> his hair shines. Indeed you are Baek In Ha's â™«</i>

540
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,780
<i>Wait for me.</i>

541
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,230
<i>W-What is this? Abstract?</i>

542
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:07,230
<i>Hey, don't do it. It's not ready.</i>

543
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,060
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

544
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,770
<i>No chance this is Yoo Jeong, right?</i>

545
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,140
<i>Wow! She says this is you.</i>

546
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:17,050
<i>Is this a painting or a ball of dust? How can you say this is Yoo Jeong?</i>

547
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,990
<i>-That's enough. She painted it well. <br>- There you go again taking her side.</i>

548
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:28,650
<i>Stop taking on her side. Because you keep doing that, she's been talking about studying abroad or an exhibition and that sort of thing.</i>

549
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:34,370
<i>Baek In Ha, tell me honestly. You keep hanging on with this level of talent because Aunt didn't let you take lessons when you were young, right?</i>

550
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:36,690
<i>You really need to give up on this. I am telling you as your brother---</i>

551
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,490
<i>- Hey punk! I'll kill you? <br> - Are you crazy?</i>

552
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,000
<i>That's enough.</i>

553
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,740
<i>You think you are all that because you can play piano some. Get your head on straight!</i>

554
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:51,350
<i>I'll close the piano lid someday and break your fingers. Understand?</i>

555
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:53,580
<i>Stop it already.</i>

556
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,850
<i>Wow! She is a complete nut job.</i>

557
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,300
<i>She doesn't even know her place.</i>

558
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,640
<i>In Ha is quitting art class.</i>

559
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,650
<i>Is that right? I guess she has come to her senses.</i>

560
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,300
<i>At least pretend like you are worried about her.</i>

561
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,800
<i>Don't you feel bad that she is trying?</i>

562
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,990
<i>She should quit when it's not working out.</i>

563
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,550
<i>Let's go play basketball.</i>

564
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:33,360
<i>Where did it go? I'll get a few grand if I sell it.</i>

565
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,950
<i>Alligator, alligator, where---</i>

566
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
<i>You are a limited edition.</i>

567
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,010
<i>Red alligator, where are you?</i>

568
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,830
<i>Why is this still here?</i>

569
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:18,020
<i>I didn't know it all then. What it meant to</i>

570
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,530
<i>give up your dreams.</i>

571
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:30,080
<i>How it feels when you remember your forgotten dreams.</i>

572
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,690
Where is the plug?

573
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,050
Where is it getting the electricity?

574
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:07,300
I didn't realize how late it was. You need to go to take the dinner crowd, right?

575
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,460
Yeah.

576
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,060
I'll be back at night to finish up.

577
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:17,440
Then I'll be grateful. Get going. They'll be busy.

578
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:22,290
This is great not riding the subway.

579
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,840
I'll take you home whenever I can. This is a date too.

580
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,760
Ah right. How are the senior classes?

581
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,860
Everybody is on edge because of the employment.

582
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:40,140
What would you like to do after graduation?

583
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,960
Not sure... I thought about studying abroad for my master's.

584
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,030
<i>Studying abroad? Then what about me?</i>

585
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:50,220
I need to do the internship properly first.

586
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:56,850
Isn't it hard to get a permanent position there?

587
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,510
Actually,

588
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:08,350
Taerang Group is my father's company.

589
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,490
What?!

590
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,740
Don't tell the other kids yet.

591
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:20,200
I am going to start from the bottom anyway.

592
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:27,300
<i>He is one of those second-generation chaebols that I've only heard about.</i>

593
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,220
<i>My family is running a noodle restaurant and Joon may not even graduate from college.</i>

594
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,610
<i>Even an internship will be hard for me...</i>

595
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,450
<i>And this person...</i>

596
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:45,510
What do you think you'll be doing in five years?

597
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,980
Probably learning about the business.

598
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,300
<i>I seem so small in here.</i>

599
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:00,950
<i>And I am not in his future.</i>

600
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:06,750
What's wrong? I said something wrong again, didn't I?

601
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,410
No.

602
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:15,650
I just... After your graduation

603
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:24,870
and after some time has passed, I am wondering if I'll still be next to you.

604
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,290
Oh. Over there.

605
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,850
Make a left turn here.

606
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,300
- This way? <br> - Yeah.

607
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,690
Here. Right here.

608
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:43,140
Thank you.

609
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,630
Seol.

610
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,150
Why worry about that?

611
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:20,930
Ahh, sorry.

612
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:24,790
No. I was just nervous.

613
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:36,720
<i>No. If I just send him away like this, then I am a rock, ROCK!</i>

614
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,150
- Sunbae. <br>- Hmm?

615
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,390
-Sunbae. <br>- Hmm?

616
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,000
Seol. Wait a minute.

617
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,400
I'll get g-going!

618
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,780
Seo---

619
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,380
Uhh? Noona, Noona, Noona!

620
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:42,840
Hey!

621
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,900
You have no umbrella, right?

622
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,950
Why are you here?

623
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:51,800
Hey! Why are you here instead of helping at the shop?

624
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,880
You drank again? Get a hold of yourself!

625
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:05,330
Uh? That's Hyung In Ho. What is he doing standing there?

626
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:15,770
What? So what will you do if you buy the electric cord?

627
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:19,700
Hyung! Hyung, Hyung.

628
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,050
Oh.

629
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:27,520
What you are two doing here?

630
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,990
- Take us home. <br>- No I have a place to go to.

631
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:34,530
Ah why? Take us to home. Noona he's taking us home.

632
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,820
Seriously you two wanting free service...

633
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:45,990
Hold it. I am being generous today. Buy me a meal if you are thankful.

634
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:47,380
What's up with you?

635
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,140
Hey! I am getting wet.

636
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:54,680
Come here.

637
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:02,080
I am back.

638
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,650
I am back.

639
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:08,220
How are you coming in together? How did you get home without the umbrella in the rain?

640
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,430
Hyung In Ho brought us home.

641
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:13,460
He must have gone to your uncle's storage room.

642
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,340
Your uncle asked for his help this afternoon. He is going to

643
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,050
organize the storage room for free at night.

644
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,330
What's the deal? I wonder if Uncle is giving him some booze.

645
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,710
Aigo this...You too get a hold of yourself.

646
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,010
Earn your own tuition during your time off.

647
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:38,250
Joon. Please just do as much as your sister is doing, huh?

648
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:42,020
You should have sent Noona to America.

649
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,120
Good job.

650
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,800
Just say that to your father. What should I hit him with?

651
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,640
Hey!

652
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:01,410
Ah Mom? Does Uncle still have his electric piano in the shop?

653
00:50:01,410 --> 00:50:03,100
Probably.

654
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,530
Ahh you scared me.

655
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:15,670
I mean...

656
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,300
This. You were going to buy this, right?

657
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,650
What is this?

658
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,690
Perhaps these...

659
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,040
If you need them.

660
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,020
How did you know?

661
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:36,840
It only needs to be plugged in.

662
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,210
Czerny, my butt.

663
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:43,120
Why did you bring these? For me to play these?

664
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,530
Since you have no sheet music, I thought you might...

665
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:50,400
What is this? The world of music file.

666
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,270
What is "Red Seol"? Is it some sort of earth warrior?

667
00:50:55,270 --> 00:50:57,430
Second grade and third classroom.

668
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:04,230
I got praised today. I felt good. Piano is fun.

669
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:09,200
More diligently tomorrow. This is full of fighting spirits.

670
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:16,130
Bayer and Czerny are a bit like that to play... I didn't think that far.

671
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:19,880
This too actually... I'll take these back.

672
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:22,220
Why are you taking that back?

673
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,440
This will just add more to the junk pile.

674
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,660
Still you gave it to me already.

675
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,890
But you don't need it.

676
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,140
You are sulking, aren't you?

677
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,140
Then why are taking it back?

678
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,110
You don't need it. What's up with you?

679
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:33,780
Oh my.

680
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,370
You need it, right? Piano fighting!

681
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,460
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

682
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,810
Fighting!

683
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:54,660
I got bewitched.

684
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,810
<i>I am being generous today. Buy me a meal if you are grateful.</i>

685
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,300
<i>What's up with him today?</i>

686
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:30,180
<i>Hey! I am getting rained on!</i>

687
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:33,500
<i>Uh ditch, ditch!</i>

688
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,350
Now you are answering the phone. Aren't you going to unfreeze my credit card?!

689
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:02,990
Hey! Are you ignoring me?!

690
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,370
You are the one who ignored the suggestion that you attend the academy.

691
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:09,310
Move out of the officetel within the month. I am going to sell it.

692
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:10,800
Wow.

693
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:22,640
Hey! I'm so pissed off

694
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,390
Ah I'm so annoyed.

695
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,100
- Hello <br> - Why yes.

696
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,120
You've eaten breakfast?

697
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,620
- Yes <br> - I was so busy...

698
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:37,000
Here it is.

699
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,030
What is this? Why are there only two for me?

700
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,110
Don't you know that I have a total of four classes this semester?

701
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:44,960
Hurry and print them out.

702
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,740
Uh the thing is...

703
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,400
What's going on. Why are you stammering?

704
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,250
To be honest uh... that. Professor, out of the classes that you uh were assigned,

705
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:54,970
there were some classes that were cancelled, soâ€”

706
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,340
- Cancelled? <br> - Yes cancelled.

707
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:01,020
- Why? <br> - It seemed like there were some problems with the way the group-based learning was run...

708
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:04,840
- What problems? <br> - The evaluation of the students... can't just be flatly ignored

709
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:08,720
So with the end-of-year evaluations in mind, how about you go easy...

710
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,700
You bastard, you.

711
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,400
Are you okay?

712
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,590
No worries. I'm, I'm fine.

713
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,760
Should I get you... How about a cup of water?

714
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,570
You eat it.

715
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,320
Organizational Behavior.

716
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,380
I've heard some rumors.

717
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:40,220
I've heard there are a lot of complains about my teamwork method of teaching.

718
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:43,820
Just why?

719
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:46,580
I am pointing out the importance of communication in my class.

720
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:53,510
Yet we can't communicate between us. Does this situation make sense?!

721
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:55,400
Does it?

722
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:02,860
Oh my. For the regular people to understand my philosophy

723
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:08,510
is asking too much, is it? If so, then I should lower my standards

724
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:13,500
to approach you? Huh?!

725
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,910
Open your books. Chapter 1.

726
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:27,030
Fine! As you wish, this semester grades will be given on an individual basis.

727
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:30,910
You prepare it as a group but present as individuals.

728
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:34,510
It will be graded as a group and as an individual 50% each.

729
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:39,380
And. Those who exhibit parasitic behavior feeding on the spines of others,

730
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,640
those who shamelessly ride free. It's fine if their names are left out. Leave them out. Okay?

731
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,420
Yes.

732
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,920
Answer me loudly. Okay?

733
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,740
Yes!

734
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,800
Hey. This is Yeoni University?

735
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,380
The school is really big.

736
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:01,730
Now that we've come to Seoul, we should eat.

737
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:02,610
Right?

738
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,990
Let's ask Noona to treat us.

739
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,440
Sure.

740
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,200
But first.

741
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,370
What's going on? <br> <i> The customer you have reached is not picking up the phone...</i>

742
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:15,570
Noona's not picking up. Is she in class?

743
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,930
Hyung. I think the business school is this way, so let's go together.

744
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:29,840
You go ahead. I'll look around first, then join you.

745
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,530
Uh what...

746
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,080
It'll be helpful for increasing the quality of working life.

747
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,640
Why don't we take a break for 10 minutes?

748
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,340
Thank you.

749
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,220
<i> From Joon: I'm here at your school with Hyung In Ho. </i>

750
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,450
<i> If you don't come out in 10 minutes, I'm going to ask Hyung Jeong to treat me to a meal. </i>

751
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:10,380
Ah seriously.

752
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:14,830
Seol! I packed sandwiches. Would you like to eat them with me? I even bought beverages...

753
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:17,030
- I'm sorry. Next time. Let's eat next time.<br> - Seol!

754
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,250
Where are you going?

755
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:24,550
You dropped this...

756
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:30,430
This belongs to Seol. This is quite cute, like Seol.

757
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,420
What is this? Is the battery out?

758
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:39,090
How can I not get connected after getting this sort of text?

759
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:49,860
Yeah.

760
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,970
Hello? Where are you right now?

761
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,770
Me?

762
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:58,340
Are you near the music department now?

763
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,860
Music department, my butt! I am at the restroom! The restroom.

764
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,210
Hâ€”

765
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,300
Music department, music department.

766
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,700
Wait! Wait!

767
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:57,280
Are you Baek In Ho?

768
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
Do you know me?

769
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,850
Of course. You were the apprentice of Professor No Eun Woo, right? Don't you remember me?

770
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,520
You were the punk who was stuck next to him, right?

771
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:11,620
Right. You still don't have any manners.

772
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,850
But what brought you here?

773
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,890
I came to the wrong place as I was passing by.

774
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:22,470
Uh just a minute. But why aren't you calling Professor No?

775
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,390
Please mind your own business.

776
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,920
In Ho! In Ho, stop!

777
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,090
Ah seriously. What is he doing not answering the phone?

778
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:34,380
Wait a minute! In Ho! In Ho!

779
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:36,240
Don't follow me!

780
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,500
- Baek In Ho! Baek In Ho! <br> - Don't follow me!

781
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,370
In Ho! In Ho! Hey student!

782
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:43,560
Student, student!

783
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,610
Do you know Baek In Ho?

784
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,510
Yeah?

785
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:55,440
I am a professor here. By chance does he attend this school?

786
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,080
No, he is not a student at this school.

787
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,250
Then, would you please hand him this business card?

788
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:05,460
Tell him to come see me sometime. Do me the favor.

789
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,000
Yes.

790
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:12,850
<i>Yeoni University <br> Professor Sim Myeong So</i>

791
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,970
Ah my doll.

792
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,050
My doll. Ah seriously!

793
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,710
Where is it?

794
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:39,750
Seol. We searched here twice already. Let's give it up.

795
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:42,100
Just a little more.

796
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,540
You bought it for me.

797
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:49,060
Why did Hong Joon have to come to school? Just wait until I get home.

798
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:51,450
Forget it. I'll buy another one for you.

799
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,910
Get out! Come here, I'll hold you.

800
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:09,260
Let's go.

801
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:15,390
Lastly. If it's not in here, then I'll really give it up.

802
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:17,780
It's not here.

803
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,950
It's really not here.

804
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:25,050
Professor, music department?

805
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:31,140
Professor asked me to give that business card to Baek In Ho.

806
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:39,170
I'll give it to him.

807
01:02:41,530 --> 01:02:43,170
Are you two you going to fight again?

808
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:46,080
I just need to hand it to him at the shop.

809
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,040
I don't like it.

810
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,970
This isn't like that, is it?

811
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,680
Yeah it is.

812
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:59,360
Then let's go together. I don't like you fighting with Baek In Ho.

813
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,170
Fine then. Let's go.

814
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:19,220
How can I be interested in playing piano now?

815
01:03:33,370 --> 01:03:35,380
You want to play piano?

816
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:48,840
I am asking if you want to play piano.

817
01:03:52,250 --> 01:03:56,240
Professor Sim Myeong Soo asked that you be given this.

818
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,400
Seeing you are poking your head here and there seems like you still have a lot of regrets.

819
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,770
Shut your mouth, bastard.

820
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:11,010
Why do you care about what I do?

821
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,530
Go study abroad. I'll support you.

822
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:20,220
Quite funny.

823
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,710
I am saying it because you seem to have changed your mind.

824
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:27,490
If you can't say it because of your pride, then there's no need for it.

825
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,580
Whether you play piano or not, do as you want.

826
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:34,620
But don't drag Seol into it while you are hesitating.

827
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:40,100
Let's go. Let's go Seol.

828
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,690
â™« <i>What lived in lonely me â™«</i>

829
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:10,480
â™« <i>Now everything has changed â™«</i>

830
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,000
<i>Sunbae why do you say it like that?</i>

831
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,730
<i> It sounds like you are trying to pick a fight.</i>

832
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,370
<i>You didn't play for five-years? What have you been doing for five-years?</i>

833
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,880
<i>I've seen enough. You may leave.</i>

834
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:17,780
<i>Isn't this yours?</i>

835
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:21,340
<i>It's mine! Are you the one who is copying me, Seol?</i>

836
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,990
<i>Hong Shil Hong Sam or whatever you are called,</i>

837
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,930
<i> I guess you didn't know you have to get my permission to date Yoo Jeong.</i>

838
01:05:25,930 --> 01:05:28,340
<i>You curly-headed redhead, YOU!</i>

839
01:05:28,340 --> 01:05:33,210
<i>Will she still be with you after knowing that you are the one who sent a stalker after her?</i>

840
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:38,330
<i>I don't like you being close to Baek In Ho, and I don't like you taking his side either.</i>

841
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:40,840
<i>I don't like you worrying about him either.</i>
