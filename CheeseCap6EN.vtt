<i>Cheese in the Trap</i>

00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,960
<i>Sunbae., why am I here?</i>

5
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,420
<i> We're not in the kind of situation to be doing this right now.<i></i></i>

6
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,580
<i>Must you argue over every detail one at a time to make you feel better?</i>

7
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,350
<i>From the beginning, you were the one who judged and misunderstood me.</i>

8
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:29,420
<i>From the beginning semester party and Sunbae Sang Cheol's embezzlement to this year's class registration.</i>

9
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,000
<i>Yet was there no way for you to overlook it for even a second?</i>

10
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,740
<i>Why do you always argue over every detail with only me?</i>

11
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,490
<i>Why is the discussion going in this direction?</i>

12
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,840
<i> Okay. Yes, let's consider the fact that last year I did wrong you. But right now, I'm doing my best.</i>

13
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,440
<i>I gave up my scholarship, helped with your report, and your part-time job at the university.</i>

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,960
<i>But why are you still not satisfied?</i>

15
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,180
<i>You know I didn't want that!</i>

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,800
<i> So what? You don't like it?</i>

17
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:15,060
<i>To be honest, you liked it. Am I wrong? Think about it.</i>

18
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,630
<i>You received all that and now I'm the bad guy?</i>

19
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,670
<i> I mean exactly how perfect do you want me to be?!</i>

20
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,910
<i>Now what are you going to?</i>

21
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,460
<i>Are you going to continue to stay away from me like this?</i>

22
00:02:56,320 --> 00:03:00,690
<i>Hong! My dad was released from the hospital! In celebration, I'm buying!</i>

23
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,540
Sunbae somehow, even in my dreams, only talks about me.

24
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,660
<i>Episode 6</i>

25
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,640
So... you are saying it's been that way for a few days and he hasn't contacted you even once?

26
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:32,670
Hey. If it were me, I would think he's too good for me, go to Gwanghwamun, and do the hula dance.

27
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,240
You should at least be grateful for having a great guy for a boyfriend.

28
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:40,540
As for me, I hate Sunbae being so nice to me like that.

29
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,590
And I'm scared I'm might get used to it.

30
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,490
So what are you going to do? Go? Stop?

31
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:53,050
Sunbae's actions are typical actions for sure, and

32
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,770
I understand that you can't accept that either.

33
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,320
How do you feel? Are you really going to break up with Sunbae?

34
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,750
<i>Sunbae, I want to meet...</i>

35
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,480
<i>I want to meet and talk.</i>

36
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,350
<i>Tomorrow...</i>

37
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,360
<i>Is tomorrow okay?</i>

38
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,710
<i>I spent all the money. Send me more money.</i>

39
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,900
This wench is seriously crazy. Why does she keep asking me for money?

40
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,420
It's a bottomless pit. When will she come to her senses?

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,970
I don't even have any money, seriously.

42
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,330
I just gave her money.

43
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,580
What are you doing?

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,480
I am in serious distress.

45
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,570
Why?

46
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,780
Over when you're going to buy me dinner.

47
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,160
It's too petty for me continue asking, too.

48
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,360
But, I'd feel wronged if I just let it go.

49
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,760
Forget it.

50
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,410
Now I understand how people feel when they lend money and can't ask for it back.

51
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,460
But why do you always talk about food every time you see me?

52
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,190
You are enjoying this.

53
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,670
You are the one who said you'd buy dinner for that robbery incident, to show your appreciation.

54
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:24,700
Wow, you're seriously pretending not to know.

55
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,440
You're awesome, seriously.

56
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,050
Ah, that's right.

57
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,490
You remember?

58
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:34,690
I'll buy. I might as well. Should I buy today?

59
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,180
- Yeah, that'd be good. Seriously?<br>- Yeah. Today? Today?

60
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,900
- Don't you run away.<br>- What do you mean run away? Okay, I'll buy today.

61
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,220
- Later, let's meet out front.<br>- Deal!

62
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,690
Hanwoo! <i>(Korean beef)</i>

63
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,960
You scared me.

64
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,820
<i>Delete<i></i></i>

65
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,670
<i>Sunbae, I want to meet and talk.</i>

66
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,180
<i>Is tomorrow okay?</i>

67
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,230
<i>It's good news. In this international piano competition,</i>

68
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,730
<i> a new Korean star is born.</i>

69
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:10,000
<i>His name is Jang Hae Jin and today we'll...</i>

70
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,580
<i>I'll be about 10 minutes late.</i>

71
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:17,070
Who sends a text over being ten minutes late?

72
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,510
<i>It is quite awesome. Among all your apprentices</i>

73
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,650
<i>Jang Hae Jin seems to be your favorite.</i>

74
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,860
<i>You've said you "found a pearl in the dirt" in an interview.</i>

75
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,400
<i>How did you find this sort of pearl?</i>

76
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,340
<i>Right from when I first met Jang Hae Jin,</i>

77
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,780
<i> he was glowing on his own.</i>

78
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,640
<i>He already possessed an awesome talent from then.</i>

79
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,070
<i>My work was to help him to play in a good environment.</i>

80
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,030
<i>Honestly, it's my</i>

81
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:00,060
<i>honor to have an apprentice like him in my life.</i>

82
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,080
<i>Baek In Ho! Are you going to just put style in front of the piano?</i>

83
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,790
<i>Are you going to play this way at the concours (competition)?</i>

84
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,990
<i>I am all prepared for it. I am playing very seriously.</i>

85
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,880
<i>You shouldn't dare say you are "prepared" in front of the piano.</i>

86
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,240
<i>Yes, I understand.</i>

87
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,870
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

88
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,260
<i>People applause when you play piano like this, don't they?</i>

89
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,490
<i>Applause is a knife and compliments are poison.</i>

90
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,500
<i>You'll know what it means later on.</i>

91
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,770
<i>You do know that you are a special apprentice to me, right?</i>

92
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,970
<i>I know.</i>

93
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,970
<i>It's killer, right?</i>

94
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,690
<i>In Ho.</i>

95
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,930
<i>Let's do the rehab.</i>

96
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,220
<i>I believe in you.</i>

97
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,500
Why are you so late?

98
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,880
Because of you, Dog Fur, I'm all wet.

99
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,590
Forget the meal.

100
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,790
Buy me a drink since it's raining.

101
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,030
Hurry up and come.

102
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,680
Why aren't you drinking?

103
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,420
I can't really drink, so I take my time.

104
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,140
Geesh. What do you do well other than study?

105
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,900
It must be nice for you since you do everything, other than studying, well.

106
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,500
What? Always talking back.

107
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,620
Did you see earlier?

108
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,380
What? Baek In Ho getting rained on?

109
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
You were here.

110
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,840
I remembered coming here together before so I stopped in.

111
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,490
You were really here.

112
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:53,180
<i>Ah. How did the situation become like...</i>

113
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,710
<i>I feel like my whole body is cowering, as if I were caught cheating</i>

114
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,870
<i>when it's clearly a situation I should be mad about.</i>

115
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,310
-Why are you mooching here? <br>-Mooching?

116
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,770
I thought I already asked you not to bother the people in my ife.

117
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,890
You act like you never heard.

118
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,110
Ah, that's right, isn't it? But what should I do?

119
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,190
I came here because Dog Fur said she'd buy me a drink, so I can't honor your request.

120
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,700
You can leave if you don't like it.

121
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,950
Yeah, if Seol said she'd buy then you should drink.

122
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,790
Please give me a glass over here.

123
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,110
You must have a lot of free time lately.

124
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,930
You have to work if you want to feed and support In Ha.

125
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,530
I don't think it's time for you to take it easy.

126
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,690
You punk. Who's the one who made us this way?

127
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,800
Bringing up my sister every chance you get.

128
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,770
Are you saying it's because of me? Why?

129
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:49,950
You said you came back because you wanted to see me like this.

130
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,630
Stop it!

131
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:54,970
You fight whenever you see each other? Why do you do this?

132
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,400
Fine then what is her sin?

133
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,190
I don't know, I don't know. Hey, just drink. Drink up.

134
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,670
Is this a group that can drink booze sober?

135
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:07,110
If only Baek In Ha were here, it would be a perfect picture, right?

136
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:10,860
<i>If it's Baek In Ha, is she Baek In Ho's older sister?</i>

137
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:13,530
<i>She was totally pretty.</i>

138
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,590
<i>How is Sunbae...</i>

139
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,890
Thanks for the text.

140
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,930
Sure.

141
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,950
Did she really call you for drinks?

142
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,630
Yeah.

143
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,590
But what does it matter to you?

144
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,140
I was a little indebted to Baek In Ho.

145
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,220
You should have told me if something like that happened.

146
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,300
We fought though.

147
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,890
Did you guys fight? What a funny pair you are.

148
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,260
If you're happy to see each other, you should be kiss-kiss-kissing.

149
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,560
Just break up. You don't suit each other!

150
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,030
Shut your mouth.

151
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,710
Do you know how he used to be long ago?

152
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,550
He had a lot of money, so he went through enough girls to fill a whole truck.

153
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,330
If you combined all their tears, it would be enough to overflow the Han River.

154
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,230
When he was bored, he'd change girls.

155
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,140
If he felt like breaking up, in an instant, BAM.

156
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,890
He's not even some king.

157
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,670
And he is obsessed with pretty faces and nice figures.

158
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,000
- Stop now.<br>- Why stop? Did I say something untrue?

159
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:23,310
A truckload of girls, with faces and figures.

160
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:33,810
Then did he date Baek In Ho's sister, too...?

161
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,560
- No!<br>- No!

162
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:38,450
- Never!<br>- What are you talking about?

163
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,490
But still,

164
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,600
when you were young, you lived together and she's pretty.

165
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,550
I said they didn't!

166
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,210
You've never dated, have you?

167
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:56,170
Who's never dated before?

168
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,010
I've dated, too. In high school.

169
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,590
Totally good looking and...

170
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:05,200
People were all jealous. He was totally good looking.

171
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,270
He was a church boy, wasn't he?

172
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,030
Huh? How did you know? He played the drums.

173
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:11,690
You chased him around because you liked him and got dumped, didn't you?

174
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:12,950
What do you know?

175
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,340
Hey, it looks like that. I can tell right away.

176
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,590
I guess you running your mouth is unfixable.

177
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:20,070
Why would I fix it? This is so fun.

178
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,430
What? What?

179
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,850
So what if you glare at me? You want to take it outside?

180
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:26,530
Aren't you scared?

181
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,290
Again, again.

182
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:33,820
Hey! A punk like you who only exercises can't win a person who actually experienced fighting.

183
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,150
If you fight me, what is that... You'll fly out of the earth's atmosphere.

184
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,070
I can't sit and listen to such childish talk.

185
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,400
Earth's atmosphere...

186
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,260
Then, what? What should I say?

187
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,690
I'll extinguish you on the mental level?

188
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:49,390
Say what? I'm a teacher at the English academy.

189
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:52,010
Why would my mentality be extinguished? My mentality is very healthy.

190
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,570
This level of conversation...

191
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,150
Enough with your crap!

192
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:58,550
Shut up, both of you!

193
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,150
Are you grade school kids?

194
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,170
Did you give me something to keep?

195
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,110
One gets mad over nothing,

196
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:09,950
and one asks me to buy things over nothing.

197
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,990
Dog Fur, are you drunk?

198
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,910
Dog Fur? Who's Dog Fur?

199
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,990
Naturally curly.

200
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,600
Natural curls, the hair that is a bit thicker. Repeat after me!

201
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,350
Oh my...

202
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,690
Seol...

203
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,990
Repeat it. Naturally curly.

204
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,510
What am I supposed to do?

205
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:45,090
If I just sit still, you think I'm not curious? I'm curious about so many things.

206
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,750
What are you curious about?

207
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,090
So, what I mean is,

208
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:55,450
Baek In Ho's sister and Sunbae's dating—

209
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,090
- I said that I didn't!<br>- I said that they didn't!

210
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,400
They didn't?

211
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,950
If not, then never mind.

212
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,230
Hey, Dog Fur!

213
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,830
Seol!

214
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,300
Seriously. The state of this woman.

215
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,540
She can't pull herself together.

216
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,430
Why are you following me?

217
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,890
Because I don't know what you're going to do with a drunk kid, so I'm following you. Why?

218
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,720
Your hand. Watch your hand. Your hand.

219
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,700
Earlier, I only let it go nicely because we were in front of Seol.

220
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,180
Mind your own business and go home.

221
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,340
Would I go if you told me to?

222
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,800
So you...

223
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,460
really...

224
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,480
don't have anything you feel sorry towards me about?

225
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,070
Then what about you?

226
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,260
Fine. I won't ask again.

227
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,690
Never again.

228
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,970
Hey!

229
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:22,170
Hey, what are men doing to a woman?

230
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:23,170
Hurry up and put her down!

231
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,690
Who are you?

232
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,990
What are you to be throwing water bottles?

233
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:29,570
Put my sister down now!

234
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,430
Hey, Hong Seol. Hey!

235
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,100
Hey, hey.

236
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,350
What is with this look?

237
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,200
Joon.

238
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,180
I think I am going to throw up?

239
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,460
What's wrong?

240
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,620
Don't do it.

241
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,160
Swallow it.

242
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,060
Hurry up and get her home.

243
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,930
What are you?

244
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,350
Did you wake up, Noona?

245
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:09,320
What are you doing? When did you get here and why are you here?

246
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,060
It's been a few days already.

247
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,700
- What about school?<br>- I'm not going to go for the time being.

248
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,310
Dad stopped his business and Mom started a noodle shop.

249
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,890
As a son, I can't just be studying in the US.

250
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:25,050
Say what? Do Mom and Dad know you're doing this?

251
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:32,720
Noona, I got beaten up by Dad. How could he do that to his son's face? I'm going to stay here for the time being.

252
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,580
Ah you, seriously! When are going to straighten up?!

253
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,600
When are you going to get your act together! You must be crazy.

254
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,180
You must be crazy. You're crazy!

255
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,940
Just know you're lucky.

256
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,870
<i>Did you sleep well? How do you feel?</i>

257
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,180
<i>Contact me when you wake up.</i>

258
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,450
Who the heck is your boyfriend?

259
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,020
What?

260
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,920
<i>Hooligan? Model student?</i>

261
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:09,220
They both looked good. But I hope it's not the model student.

262
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,340
Why?

263
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,620
Don't you remember?

264
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,020
Really?

265
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,590
You threw up on the model student's head yesterday!

266
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,050
Really?

267
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,170
You threw up on the model student's head yesterday!

268
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,880
Really?

269
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,090
Oooooeeeeeyaaaa!

270
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,220
You vomited in front of the door. It was so gross.

271
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,680
You'll get dumped by that model student soon.

272
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,670
Seriously. Seriously. You scared me!

273
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:59,730
I said that you scared me! You scared me! You scared me!

274
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,540
It's short hair!

275
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:08,530
I should die! I should just die!

276
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,890
I'm never going to drink again.

277
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:18,250
Seriously, last night... Last night was...

278
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:21,950
Oh. Mm-hmm.

279
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:28,800
Yeah, Mom. I'll take him for the next few days. Don't worry. Yes.

280
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,810
You're leaving now?

281
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,070
Yes. What are you doing?

282
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,700
I'm moving.

283
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,890
The owner grandmother hasn't come yet.

284
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,880
I was just going to leave first.

285
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,480
But, why?

286
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:51,080
I have a favor to ask you. About Yoon Seob and me.

287
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,840
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

288
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,560
Thanks.

289
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:04,340
Dear, when I first saw you and abused you saying you were noisy, I'm sorry.

290
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,780
Not at all.

291
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,550
Be well.

292
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:21,920
<i>I'm sure we fought because I got mad. Alcohol is my enemy.</i>

293
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,850
Did you get home okay last night?

294
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,660
I was thinking about it.

295
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:33,150
Let's not think.

296
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:39,850
Seol, don't go anywhere and drink a lot, okay?

297
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,470
Okay.

298
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:50,030
Did I make a lot of mistakes last night?

299
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,440
Do you really want to know?

300
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,100
No.

301
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,430
Well, just... It was cute to me.

302
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,910
The man next door moved out.

303
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,620
He did?

304
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,240
Sunbae.

305
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,540
Hmm?

306
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,820
I'm sorry for getting mad after only hearing what Teacher Heo had to say.

307
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:28,860
Since I know that you didn't have bad motives, I'll be understanding about it this time.

308
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,470
But, from now on, promise me that these things won't happen again in the future.

309
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,430
And ask me first if it involves me.

310
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,430
Okay. I promise.

311
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:56,400
Let's eat here. And I was thinking we could go see a movie. What do you think?

312
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,820
A movie?

313
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,200
I reserved them already, for something funny.

314
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,920
I came here prepared to get scolded more. Is this enough?

315
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,000
I'll let it go this time.

316
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,780
Come out, punk. I saw it all. Who is it? Who is it?

317
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,620
In Ho!

318
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,760
This punk.

319
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,900
How did you get here? Did the president make you?

320
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:48,560
I saved you when you were getting tormented. Gave you money to help you to get a place. You repay my grace by being my enemy?

321
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:54,420
No. I really came because I saw this.

322
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,550
Get rid of that.

323
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,910
But the problem is, the president already knows. For now, get out of here.

324
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,440
I'm going to go crazy.

325
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,890
And also, if you change your cell number, you have to let me know.

326
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:10,940
In Ho, let's go eat since it's been a long time since I saw you.

327
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:14,510
Eat, my foot. Go punk! Go!

328
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,980
- Go already!<br>- I'm going, I'm going.

329
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,380
Okay! I'm going!

330
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,480
I am leaving In Ho! Stay well!

331
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,230
How did he know? Agh!

332
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,580
Do I have to leave again? I have to leave just as I get used to the place...

333
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:35,390
I have to change my number. I have to move out.

334
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,820
Baek In Ha, what did you do now?

335
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,470
No wonder. I thought my life was too peaceful.

336
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,570
It's me In Ha. Have you been well?

337
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,970
<i>Yeah, what's up? You're calling me first.</i>

338
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:16,450
It's just that I haven't seen you in a long time. Do you have time tomorrow? Want to meet up?

339
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:21,440
<i>Why? Did you run out of money? Is there nobody who will see you?</i>

340
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,710
<i>What can I do? I have to see my girlfriend tomorrow.</i>

341
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:29,810
Seriously! I felt pity for you so I was going to see you.

342
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:34,570
<i>Who's the one who's really pitiful? I knew you'd turn out like that.</i>

343
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:39,680
<i>If you are desperate, then go see that hooligan. Don't call again.</i>

344
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,500
Hey! HEY!

345
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:51,100
If I ask Baek In Ho for money, he's going to freak, freak, freak, freak, FREAK out again!

346
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,430
Baek In Ho is going to freak out!

347
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,430
I don't have any money.

348
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,980
Seriously, you!

349
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,040
And don't call me for the time being. I'm going to run off for a bit. Although you won't be able to contact me when I change my number anyway.

350
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,690
What are you talking about? Did you cause some trouble?

351
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,810
What does it matter to you? You're not even going to help fix it anyway.

352
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,090
Sorry.

353
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,680
The chicken was good, and I enjoyed the movie.

354
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,430
That's a good thing.

355
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,970
When are you moving out?

356
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,060
Soon, before the semester starts.

357
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:51,220
Things are coming to the end. The academy, my place and the school vacation.

358
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,920
It's sad.

359
00:29:54,920 --> 00:30:00,410
But not us. We'll still see each other.

360
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,560
That's right.

361
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,480
Here.

362
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:24,090
Because you like watches.

363
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,690
I didn't even expect this.

364
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:35,400
But I wonder if it's too inexpensive for you to wear, so I'm a little embarrassed.

365
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,980
Is it not good?

366
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,250
You must not like it.

367
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,170
I like it.

368
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,970
Really.

369
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,400
Thanks.

370
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,690
<i>We didn't fight yesterday. And we had a good conversation.</i>

371
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,650
<i>It would be nice if every day was like yesterday.</i>

372
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,840
<i>What do I do? What do I do? I must be crazy.</i>

373
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,090
Hey, Natural Curls!

374
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,910
This is where you were.

375
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,290
So? Are you feeling better?

376
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,510
Natural Curls?

377
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,140
Stop that.

378
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,740
What? I can't even call Natural Curls by Natural Curls anymore?

379
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,880
Nat... Natural Curls?

380
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,470
Seriously! I said to stop that!

381
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:59,880
Hey, now you're shouting at me.

382
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,500
I've raised you too high.

383
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,090
I've raised you too high, I did...

384
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,910
Where are you going?

385
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,810
Can I not see her again, either?

386
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:18,570
It was a mistake to drink with him.

387
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,450
Welcome.

388
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,180
Please give me a pack of cigarettes.

389
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:28,180
<i>What is it? Why is Yeong Gon here?</i>

390
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:31,680
<i>Hey, stop right there!</i>

391
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,530
<i>Seriously!</i>

392
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,990
<i>I said let's talk.</i>

393
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,160
<i>Why are you so cold to me lately?</i>

394
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,110
<i>You don't answer my calls and ignore my texts.</i>

395
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,250
<i>Then it seems like it's only me who likes you.</i>

396
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,240
<i>You... Are you crazy?</i>

397
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,420
<i>Why would I like you?</i>

398
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,560
<i>If you keep doing this, I'm going to report you to the police for stalking.</i>

399
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,550
<i>Stalking? Stalking doesn't refer to us.</i>

400
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,850
<i>We're just in a game of push-pull. Push-pull. Understand?</i>

401
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:04,260
<i>But why do you keep playing hard to get? I'm getting annoyed.</i>

402
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:10,380
<i>The sky and ground know the fact that you like me. Even Yoo Jeong knows, too.</i>

403
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,320
<i>- What?<br>- You said you liked me!</i>

404
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,470
<i>I got hope because Sunbae Yoo Jeong gave me assurance.</i>

405
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,730
<i>Hey, he said we look really good together.</i>

406
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,920
<i>What in the world are you talking about?</i>

407
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,660
<i>I'm getting really annoyed.</i>

408
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,680
<i>Come here.</i>

409
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,460
<i>I said to follow me!</i>

410
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,000
<i>Come here!</i>

411
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,950
Is this the correct one?

412
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,680
It's 8,500 Won.

413
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:43,290
- Thank you.<br>- Thank you. Good bye.

414
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:55,490
<i>Could he possibly be going to an academy near here?</i>

415
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:58,160
<i>What do I do if I run into him?</i>

416
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,110
I should take the back street.

417
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,040
Hong Seol?

418
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,860
Hey! So it was you!

419
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,180
Earlier in the convenience store I thought it might be you.

420
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,960
But do you go to an academy near here?

421
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,600
What is it? It's as if you're seeing me for the first time. Did you already forget me after taking a year off?

422
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,190
I don't have anything to say to you.

423
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,470
Where are you going? I'm not finished talking.

424
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:24,490
I have something to say, I really do.

425
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,420
Let go!

426
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:30,610
What's wrong? You're embarrassing me.

427
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,390
I don't have any feelings for you anymore.

428
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,450
I'm going to start back in school again so let's get along.

429
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,830
I don't have anything to say.

430
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,470
You're still so prickly.

431
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,340
Don't be like that. You're breaking my heart.

432
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:48,560
But, I heard you've been close to Yoo Jeong lately.

433
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,720
Are you dating?

434
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,250
Really? Really?

435
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,570
You and I both got fooled properly by him and now you are dating him?

436
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,140
Is he in his right mind?

437
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,670
- Go away. <br> - Get a hold of yourself, wench!

438
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:05,660
He wouldn't be sincere with you! He's playing with you, I say!

439
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,280
I said to get away!

440
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,630
Ah, you're treating me like a bug.

441
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:15,530
Hey, you've got some good skills.

442
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,210
How did you seduce Yoo Jeong?

443
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,410
Someone who couldn't say a word to a boy and used to be such a loser.

444
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,060
Ahh this...

445
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,660
I was listening and listening, but it was rotting my ears and I couldn't take it anymore.

446
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,110
Hey, who are you to hit someone's back?

447
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,690
What are you, bastard?

448
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,320
What are you to hold a girl on a street like a loser?

449
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,680
You really...

450
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
I was going to let you hit me and get a settlement.

451
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,220
But it won't work because you are too slow with your fist.

452
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,640
Hong Seol, you're quite amazing.

453
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,270
Yoo Jeong, Kwon Eun Taek, and now even this bully.

454
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,870
You still can't get your act straight.

455
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,720
You nagged at me for hitting on girls.

456
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,060
But you are the slut coming on to this guy and that guy!

457
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,450
Hey!

458
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
I know about punks like you very well.

459
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,650
There is no remedy for a loser like you who torments girls.

460
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:12,550
I am the remedy.

461
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,720
Ah, Baek...!

462
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,210
Are you scared?

463
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,110
Get lost.

464
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,120
I said to get lost!

465
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,410
Such a loser.

466
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,650
Hey! I'm going to sue you! I'm going to throw you in jail!

467
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,000
Try it! Just try to!

468
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,700
Hey! Try it and see if I sit still.

469
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,850
If you go to the police, I'll be a witness.

470
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:43,460
Stalking me starting last year and threatening me today!

471
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,120
Let's see who the defendant will be.

472
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,450
Good job. You're doing well.

473
00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:50,090
Okay, do whatever you want!

474
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,130
But soon, you're going to be hurt by Yoo Jeong.

475
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,630
Think carefully.

476
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,650
Why did that punk send me to you last year?

477
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,880
Let's get along this semester.

478
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,100
You are just all talk.

479
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,420
Get lost! I said to get lost!

480
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,200
Aissi get lost!

481
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,290
You just let me see you again. I'll rearrange your organs!

482
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,720
Hey, Dog Fur. Who was he?

483
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,980
He is involved with Yoo Jeong, right?

484
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,210
Be careful from now on.

485
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:24,340
And be careful about that sort of guy who has victim mentality, too.

486
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,590
Yoo Jeong will eat him alive. He's more dispensable than gum.

487
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:29,620
Got it?

488
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,120
I asked if you understand?

489
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,380
Hurry up and go back. You'll be late for the exam.

490
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,860
Ahh, Teacher!

491
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,760
- What's with you kids? Go, go, go. <br> - We like you, Teacher!

492
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,400
Go home! See you later!

493
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,270
See you tomorrow!

494
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,390
Thomas, some girl asked me to give you something earlier.

495
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:03,030
Girl...?

496
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:06,360
My fans are driving me crazy. What is it?

497
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,620
It's in that bag.

498
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,550
Who gave this to you?

499
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,980
I don't her name but you know that girl with frizzy hair and with her eyes half open.

500
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,160
Don't forget to take those. It's messy.

501
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,110
Dog fur.

502
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,000
Why is she going and doing unnecessary things like this?

503
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,120
The words you are seeing now, people think these words are easy.

504
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,360
But these are words people mispronounce a lot.

505
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,970
So, how do you pronounce this?

506
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,200
<i>The sky and the ground know the fact that you like me.</i>

507
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,930
<i>Even Yoo Jeong knows it.</i>

508
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,820
<i>Think carefully. Why would he have sent me to you last year?</i>

509
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,000
<i>Yoo Jeong eats people like that alive. He's more dispensable than gum.</i>

510
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,630
<i>Understand?</i>

511
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:01,300
It means it's chilly. So changing the word "chilly"

512
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,960
to weather, than in any test...

513
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:11,650
<i>We just finally got to liking each other.</i>

514
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,510
<i>Let's not bring up tiring stuff again.</i>

515
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,560
Hey, Dog Fur!

516
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,330
Sunbae!

517
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,880
What's up?

518
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:32,370
I wanted to take you home.

519
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,090
Get in.

520
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,750
Anyway, then I don't have to bother taking her home.

521
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,940
It's nice.

522
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,010
This isn't awkward anymore. Is it?

523
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,370
You wore the watch.

524
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:13,840
I'm going to wear it every day.

525
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,660
It looks good on you.

526
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,550
What's wrong?

527
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,560
It seemed like someone was there.

528
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,170
There's nobody here.

529
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:38,200
I must have been wrong.

530
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,240
Let's go.

531
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,140
Oh! Here she comes!

532
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,620
You're friends with that pervert, aren't you?

533
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,790
Yeah, I heard you even drank with him. Where did that pervert go?

534
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,280
He isn't that kind of person.

535
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,550
Can you give me a description of your next door neighbor?

536
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:00,950
He's a little short. And he's chubby.

537
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:05,060
- The person who was with you at the police station last time.<br>- Yes, that's correct!

538
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:09,900
Earlier you said he was tall, had red hair and a hat.

539
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:15,720
He could have lost weight and dyed his hair. It's him! There's nobody it could be but him!

540
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,920
You have the wrong person. Why are you doing that?

541
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,210
Where are you going, Miss? You have to give us that pervert's address before you go!

542
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,630
Give me his address!

543
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:28,210
Ahjussi, seriously!

544
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:34,660
I'm worried they didn't catch the criminal.

545
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,330
He won't come back, will he?

546
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,220
Why are you saying things that scare me?

547
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:46,960
You should get going.

548
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,450
Should I stay here today?

549
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,740
What?

550
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,460
You said your brother was staying out all night.

551
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,190
Will you be okay alone?

552
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:11,590
Joon is so messy.

553
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,520
He made such a big mess.

554
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,200
Here. Sit here for now.

555
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,490
Ah, coffee. Coffee!

556
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:29,360
I don't need any coffee.

557
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,820
Pardon?

558
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,680
I'll just have some water.

559
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:46,080
Here.

560
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,190
I'll go and change my clothes quickly.

561
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,480
Oh.

562
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,090
Keep sitting.

563
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:41,460
<i>Sunbae is in my room. It's strange.</i>

564
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:48,710
<i>When did I start trusting the person I was so wary of?</i>

565
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:50,880
Should we watch TV?

566
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,090
- You have a TV?<br>- Yes.

567
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:59,040
I don't watch it often, so I keep it in my closet.

568
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,390
I k-kept it.

569
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,590
Why is the TV underneath the blankets.

570
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:06,760
Since I don't watch it very often.

571
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,620
This is a little old.

572
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,300
I'll help you.

573
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,360
It's the old kind so it's a little heavy.

574
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:21,560
This, this...

575
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,100
Take this ou—

576
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,090
This, this...

577
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:40,980
Take this ou—

578
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:00,930
It's okay. We don't have to watch TV.

579
00:46:04,430 --> 00:46:06,930
What should I do with these blankets?

580
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,470
Sunbae.

581
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:19,460
Let's go to sleep now.

582
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,240
I mean, sleep. We should sleep.

583
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,480
Okay.

584
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,570
Okay, then.

585
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,420
Spread this on the floor.

586
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,080
And this is to cover yourself.

587
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,210
Good night. Please turn out the light.

588
00:46:55,210 --> 00:46:57,150
Okay.

589
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:04,330
Good night.

590
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,250
Okay, sleep well.

591
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,590
You can't fall asleep?

592
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,710
How about you?

593
00:47:56,710 --> 00:48:00,510
How can I sleep when you're making so much noise?

594
00:48:05,330 --> 00:48:08,770
It's only 10:30pm.

595
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,750
Please turn on the light.

596
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,520
Oh.

597
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,820
What should we do?

598
00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:34,530
Is this your photo album? Can I look at it?

599
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,040
Yes.

600
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,270
It's from when I was little.

601
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,570
- Is this all you?<br>- Yes.

602
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,240
You're cute.

603
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,830
Look at how long your legs are.

604
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,980
You're eyes were really big when you were young.

605
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:04,890
What?

606
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,680
Oh, your father?

607
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:13,460
The curly hair.

608
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,960
Don't I look like a triangle kimbap? They said it was extremely curly then.

609
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,410
It's loosened up a lot.

610
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,020
Try to find me in this one.

611
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,240
You're right.

612
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,800
You look the same.

613
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:43,830
You must have been close with Joon since you were young.

614
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:47,510
Well, we're still close now.

615
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:51,940
But there is a hateful side in Joon.

616
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,850
Since he was young, he grew up doing everything he wanted to.

617
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:00,710
He was so cute and outgoing.

618
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:03,840
My parents just

619
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,660
let everything slide for him.

620
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,520
They were very generous to Joon.

621
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,720
There are people like that.

622
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,330
People who are easily loved.

623
00:50:15,330 --> 00:50:17,680
But, well...

624
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,190
That's not something that happens just because you try.

625
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:28,750
When I was young, I thought I was someone who couldn't be smart.

626
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:32,980
So I did everything diligently, I think.

627
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,770
And while doing that, the results just naturally got better.

628
00:50:37,770 --> 00:50:43,090
Actually, even now, that's why I just try hard.

629
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:49,120
But at some point, it became a habit

630
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:52,480
and was expected.

631
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,260
Even though it might have been just a small mistake, it seemed like a big offense.

632
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,360
Like that...

633
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:05,230
I'm being so down.

634
00:51:07,110 --> 00:51:09,210
I'm the same way.

635
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,660
You are?

636
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:17,860
My father is very kind and generous to others.

637
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:23,860
But he had a certain expectation of me, so I had to match that.

638
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,370
I have to be friendly, and I can't get mad.

639
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:31,070
It wasn't forced but...

640
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,250
Sometimes it felt suffocating...

641
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:49,930
Seol.

642
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:54,800
If I were your parents, I would have adored you a lot.

643
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,740
It's really good to see

644
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,760
you trying hard.

645
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:10,910
Don't worry. You're doing well enough now.

646
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,700
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

647
00:52:15,530 --> 00:52:18,120
<i>I'm doing well.</i>

648
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,700
<i>Those are the words I've been wanting to hear from someone.</i>

649
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,200
Sunbae, what did you like about me?

650
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,310
Hm?

651
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,120
I mean, we weren't really that close.

652
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,460
I even thought you hated me.

653
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,690
I did dislike you.

654
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:53,290
So, when did you change your mind?

655
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,820
<i>You did the least research so of course you have to present.</i>

656
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:02,190
<i>You only did the introduction and I did the main.</i>

657
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:05,910
<i>Seol made all the corrections and organized it anyway.</i>

658
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,370
<i>What's the difference between us?</i>

659
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:11,320
<i>I'll just do it.</i>

660
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:17,490
<i>Since I summarized the PPT, I think we can present without the script once I sort things out.</i>

661
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:20,460
<i>- Oh, you want to?<br>- I feel so sorry.</i>

662
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,360
<i>- But, now that I think about it...<br>- Hey, Seol is really similar to you.</i>

663
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,760
<i>- What are you talking about?<br>- Just know that you two are exactly the same.</i>

664
00:53:29,990 --> 00:53:32,390
<i>Aigoo, I'm going.</i>

665
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:34,960
<i>Oh, Sunbae! You need to put up the posters. It's your duty.</i>

666
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,380
<i>I helped with the shop. Tell the other kids who skipped it.</i>

667
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:43,270
<i>Why do I have to work so hard?! You can get out of it if you feel wronged, too! Ah, I am so hungry.</i>

668
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:46,940
<i>Seriously, there he goes again.</i>

669
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:52,350
<i>We'll hand out the flyers. So would you put up the posters and information?</i>

670
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:58,220
<i>Let's put up the posters and information since it takes a lot of time and do this tomorrow.</i>

671
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:03,930
<i>I have prior engagement too. Handing out the flyers is a lot you know.</i>

672
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,950
<i>But the event is tomorrow...</i>

673
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:09,250
<i>Okay, I'll put up the posters with Seol.</i>

674
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:13,600
<i>I heard you are not feeling well. You seem to have a nasty cold, so let's just go.</i>

675
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,860
<i>Not at all. We'll wrap it up, so don't worry about it and go on.</i>

676
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,310
<i>Then, Min Soo, come with me.</i>

677
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:32,290
<i>You leave too. If you use the back gate, you can probably avoid the kids.</i>

678
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,930
<i>We need to put up the posters.</i>

679
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,410
<i>I can do it.</i>

680
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,720
<i>Just go.</i>

681
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,140
<i>No one will appreciate your effort anyway.</i>

682
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,800
<i>I understand that I look foolish, but whether anyone notices my effort or not</i>

683
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,510
<i>I am doing it because it's more comfortable doing it alone.</i>

684
00:55:01,510 --> 00:55:04,960
<i>Isn't it the same for you?</i>

685
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,350
<i>Why are you sleeping here?</i>

686
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
When did you start to like me?

687
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:12,750
I'm not too sure.

688
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:14,770
It's a secret.

689
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:20,100
What the heck?

690
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,900
How was it for you? You also really disliked me.

691
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,070
Yeah, I did.

692
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,280
So much I wanted to take time off school.

693
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:35,740
So I felt very uncomfortable getting the scholarship because of you.

694
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:40,100
But suddenly at some point you asked me to eat with you.

695
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:42,620
There were so many times you surprised me.

696
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,040
You kept popping up from somewhere and helping me.

697
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,750
You kept showing up at mealtime and asking me to eat with you.

698
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,870
And you suddenly asked to date.

699
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:58,120
But, suddenly, I couldn't contact you.

700
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:01,980
Honestly, even now,

701
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:06,910
you being here is really weird for me.

702
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,530
So, how is it now?

703
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:14,830
You don't dislike me now?

704
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:21,040
<i>I don't know how we end up sitting together like this.</i>

705
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,940
<i>But if I like this moment, isn't that enough?</i>

706
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:30,960
That's a secret too.

707
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,980
I'm really going to sleep now.

708
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,360
Let's really go to sleep.

709
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:44,740
- Please turn the light off.<br>- Yes.

710
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:51,200
- Goodnight.<br>- Yes.

711
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:58,100
Sunbae, are you okay? Are you okay?

712
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:01,280
I'm okay, I'm okay.

713
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,920
I'm okay.

714
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:06,770
This place is too small for your height, isn't it?

715
01:00:11,950 --> 01:00:14,900
Hong Seol, here...

716
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,600
Huh? What's with this bastard?

717
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,480
He goes to the same academy with Hong Seol?

718
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:25,180
Great.

719
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,610
I'll take care of that bastard first.

720
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:35,800
I am exposing the true identity of this academy instructor.

721
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:42,170
Hong Seol you just come back to school. I'll expose that bastard's true identity.

722
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:49,120
Our academy's homepage is flooded because of you.

723
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:50,580
Ah, why?

724
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:56,990
How can you beat up another academy's student in front of ours? You face is even on our poster.

725
01:00:56,990 --> 01:01:03,110
He said he won't report to the police. But since things turned out this way, we can't help it, either.

726
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:08,470
I'll deposit this month's pay, so you don't need to come back.

727
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,220
I understand.

728
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:18,020
Thanks for everything and I enjoyed it.

729
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:20,660
Then.

730
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,990
I'm sorry.

731
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,560
It's okay.

732
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,350
Then.

733
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:33,830
Let me see him too!

734
01:01:33,830 --> 01:01:38,520
What is this? Why are you here? Go hurry!

735
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,870
- Go! Go quickly!<br>- No!

736
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:45,580
- Go! Go quickly! Go!<br>- No!

737
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:50,530
- No!<br>- You guys, seriously.

738
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,760
Oh, oh! Teacher has to go.

739
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,770
No!

740
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:00,650
I'll talk to the Director since it happened because of me.

741
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:05,820
Don't worry about it. I was going to leave Seoul anyway. It's perfect timing.

742
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:08,010
Why?

743
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,930
Well.

744
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:15,900
I don't stay in one place very long anyway.

745
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:20,940
Ah right. If that loser comes again, don't even respond to him and just avoid him,

746
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,500
since I won't be here from now on. Got it?

747
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:32,570
You won't come from now on?

748
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:37,020
What's with that expression?

749
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:39,800
Why? Are you disappointed?

750
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:43,530
You're disappointed the handsome Baek In Ho is leaving?

751
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:49,480
You are for real? You might end up crying at this rate.

752
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,340
I met a lot of women, so I know.

753
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,070
It's really ugly if you cry with a face like this.

754
01:02:59,950 --> 01:03:04,550
Who says I am crying? I'm not disappointed at all.

755
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,750
Then, it's fine.

756
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,310
Take care.
