3
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,850
I'm not kidding. You really do look old.

4
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,130
Look in the mirror, you'll be shocked.

5
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,950
Sunbae.

6
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,230
I heard there's a thief in the neighborhood.

7
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,960
Just in case, I checked the door and the windows.

8
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:23,220
Yes.

9
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,110
It's funny. Yoo Jeong caring about others.

10
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,950
Because she's my girlfriend.

11
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,020
No wonder. Because of this great girlfriend of yours,

12
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,090
you cut off my sister?

13
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,950
Seol, go upstairs first. Go in.

14
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,610
Okay.

15
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,570
Is that why? Because I was hitting on your girlfriend?

16
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,630
I forgot about how you backstab people.

17
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:11,880
I am going to put your sister's place on the market. Don't you think it's too luxurious for a woman with no income?

18
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,400
You jerk. Seriously.

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,950
Or you can quit your job at the academy.

20
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,320
Then, I'll think about it.

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,330
You must be bothered that I'm back.

22
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:28,930
But what will you do? I don't plan on going back to the way you want, even if I die.

23
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,210
Is that so?

24
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,500
Why? Do you also want to break my right hand?

25
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,880
Do you really want that?

26
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,920
Of course, this is the moment I like the most.

27
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,580
When your mask is removed.

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,820
Let's see each other often, Yoo Jeong.

29

<i>Episode 5</i>

30
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,080
Sunbae, wait a minute!

31
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,780
Sunbae.

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,520
I told you to avoid him, but he even walks you home?

33
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,030
No, it wasn't on purpose.

34
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,850
It's because it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella.

35
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,960
We met at the academy by chance and we were going the same way--

36
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,410
Why didn't you tell me?

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,920
I thought that it would bother you.

38
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,380
I'm sorry.

39
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,760
But, Sunbae, why are you getting mad?

40
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,600
Do as I say. If I said to avoid him, then you should've avoided him no matter what.

41
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,040
<i> Sunbae never talks to me about him. </i>

42
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,950
<i>But I too...</i>

43
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,770
Why?

44
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,030
<i> I too, have held back for a long time. </i>

45
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,320
Why should I avoid Baek In Ho?

46
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,280
Why do I absolutely need to do whatever you tell me to do?

47
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:54,390
I need to be convinced so I can decide on whether to avoid him or not.

48
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,030
You said you weren't friends. Are you saying you won't avoid him if I don't tell you?

49
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:04,430
Is that the only reason... why I should avoid him?

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,160
Let's stop this. I don't want to fight with you.

51
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,430
- Go home and we'll talk about it tomo-- <br> - When tomorrow comes,

52
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,340
what will be different?

53
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:36,630
Whether I apologize or ask questions, you don't listen.

54
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:42,680
Without an explanation, you tell me to avoid him, to stop this, but what can I do?

55
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,330
What am I to you?

56
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,190
Is this dating?

57
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,180
I'm leaving.

58
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,010
Hello? Oh, Bo Ra.

59
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,380
<i>Seol, what should I do?</i>

60
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,630
What's wrong? Did something happen?

61
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,780
<i>I called when he was on the floor.</i>

62
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,580
<i> He couldn't talk, so I called 119. </i>

63
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,670
What did you say?

64
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:28,430
<i>Dad...</i>

65
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,900
What about the floor?

66
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,060
<i>Dad is...</i>

67
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,690
Bo Ra, where are you? I'm going there right now.

68
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,450
Okay, I'll be right there.

69
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,040
Let's talk.

70
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,900
- Later.

71
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,470
- Seol! <br> - Bo Ra's father collapsed!

72
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,700
I understand, so let's take my car.

73
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,020
Is he in critical condition?

74
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,540
Bo Ra went home and found her father passed out on the floor.

75
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:30,440
She must be alone right now. Ever since her mom passed away, she's been alone.

76
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,990
I'll drive faster.

77
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,780
Noona Bo Ra!

78
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,910
Why? Why did you just come? Why? You jerk.

79
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,430
Are you alright?

80
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,630
What is going to happen to my dad? What will happen if something goes wrong?

81
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,650
Bo Ra, I'm sorry. Don't cry, I'm sorry.

82
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,600
Everything will be alright.

83
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,170
How will I live if something happens to my dad?

84
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:10,730
Don't talk like that. It's going to be okay. Trust me.

85
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,570
Bo Ra!

86
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,980
Seol, Seol.

87
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:20,260
It's going to be alright. It's going to be alright.

88
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:24,470
Excuse me, do you have an empty room?

89
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:26,350
I think she is exhausted from crying so much.

90
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,930
Please follow me this way.

91
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:33,040
Have her lie down in there for now. We'll stay here.

92
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:40,560
Let me down, I can walk.

93
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,740
Sit down. Let's wait sitting down.

94
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,740
Don't worry.

95
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,770
<i> Because she's my girlfriend. </i>

96
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,370
<i>That's interesting.</i>

97
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,160
<i>It's really interesting.</i>

98
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,550
Do you want to sleep?

99
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:49,830
No, I'm going to wait here.

100
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,120
Why? If you sleep, Bo Ra's father won't get worse.

101
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:01,150
That's right, but...

102
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,460
Operating room is ready, right?

103
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,340
<i> - Is the anesthesiologist on his way? <br> - The doctor is on the way.</i>

104
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,090
What's wrong?

105
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:09,480
No, blood.

106
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,090
It's the hospital. Are you not familiar with it? It'll be alright.

107
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,730
The guardian for patient Jang Yeong Hoo?

108
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,210
That's Bo Ra's father.

109
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,180
I'll go.

110
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,130
Patient Jang Young Hoo had a cerebral hemorrhage.

111
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:32,460
But I think he'll be alright since we caught it early.

112
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,070
Thank you.

113
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,350
It's really a relief.

114
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,790
Then, you should get some sleep.

115
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,250
I'll go get some blankets.

116
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,640
<i> I like that I can lean on him, but... </i>

117
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,960
<i>But something's been off since earlier.</i>

118
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,780
♫ <i>You probably hated me today ♫</i>

119
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:19,560
♫ <i> I hate myself sometimes too ♫</i>

120
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,840
♫ <i> Even so please don't hate me ♫</i>

121
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:35,490
♫ <i> Can you just recognize me? ♫</i>

122
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:41,810
♫ <i>No matter what anyone says or how I am ♫</i>

123
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,440
Surgery is over for patient Jang Yeong Hoo.

124
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,700
<i>You can go to the recovery room.</i>

125
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,160
Yes.

126
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,340
Did you wake up?

127
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,050
Uhm, I heard. Let's go.

128
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,330
<i>Thank you.</i>

129
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,470
Bo Ra.

130
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,890
Thank goodness he is over the critical stage.

131
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,880
They say he was very lucky.

132
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,690
You suffered. Don't worry too much.

133
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:22,150
Thank you for staying with me this late.

134
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,550
My dad's friends are coming, so you can go home.

135
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,930
I'm going to stay here.

136
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:29,070
Really?

137
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,370
How can I leave Noona alone?

138
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,390
Seol, go home. Sunbae, go home too.

139
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,100
See you.

140
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,200
Do you know how many times I called you? You were playing games, weren't you?

141
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,720
Ah, did I? I don't remember--

142
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,480
You can't be found when I need you.

143
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,260
I don't like you...

144
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,500
From now on, I won't ignore your calls.

145
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,890
- Really, let go. <br> - Never.

146
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,740
You smell.

147
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,330
Go wash up. Don't even come near me.

148
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,250
What? How can I smell?

149
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,180
It smells good.

150
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,810
I'm sorry.

151
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,040
It wasn't right for me to get mad.

152
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,550
No, I did wrong.

153
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,850
Let's sit for a moment.

154
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,930
Baek In Ho...

155
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:52,350
He is a grandson of the professor my father used to respect.

156
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:57,350
When Professor passed away, my family took him in and supported him.

157
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,230
In Ho played piano really well.

158
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,990
But, in a fight in high school, he hurt his hand.

159
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,830
And he thinks that it's my fault.

160
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:16,590
I've told him numerous times that it was not.

161
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,700
But, the misunderstanding is still there.

162
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,800
That's why I told you to avoid him.

163
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,690
Just in case he would do something weird to you, since he has bad feelings towards me.

164
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,420
Is my explanation enough?

165
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,700
<i> He says it's simply a misunderstanding, but it feels like something deeper. </i>

166
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,650
<i> Sure, let's believe Sunbae for now. </i>

167
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,210
Yes.

168
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,860
Seol, are you uncomfortable with me?

169
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,660
You didn't answer my calls yesterday and you've been acting strangely.

170
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,550
<i> That's right, rather than continuing to bottle it up... </i>

171
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,110
To be honest...

172
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:17,040
Nam Joo Yeon came by today at the department.

173
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,590
Do you remember when I hurt my arm during midterms?

174
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:24,710
I got injured fighting with a homeless person the day before.

175
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,370
Nam Joo Yeon says that it was her doing.

176
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:33,470
And that she asked for your help,

177
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,790
but you just left.

178
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,510
After hearing those words, I felt upset.

179
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,470
You knew about the situation, but still didn't help me.

180
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:51,050
Why did you ask to date me?

181
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,990
I called the security guards.

182
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:54,820
What?

183
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,810
I said that to Nam Joo Yeon,

184
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:02,270
but I called the security guards and patrolled with them right away.

185
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:09,550
I asked you the day afterwards if you were hurt,

186
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,410
but you told me it because of a tuna can.

187
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:18,730
I thought you hid that fact in case there were rumors.

188
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,210
But, you...

189
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:32,630
Did you just believe Nam Joo Yeon, like that?

190
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,150
No, I mean...

191
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,910
It's quite upsetting.

192
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,220
I'm sorry.

193
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,910
From now on, if there's something upsetting, I will talk you right away to avoid misunderstandings.

194
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:04,960
I also, from now on, won't do things that make you mad.

195
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,230
I didn't eat the whole day.

196
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,580
Ah, when I went to get the blankets,

197
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,720
I thought you might be hungry, so I bought these.

198
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,780
Ah, really?

199
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,040
Triangle kimbap.

200
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll open it.

201
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,800
I will eat well.

202
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,650
<i>He doesn't like chaos.</i>

203
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:05,870
<i> Even if he is misunderstood, he won't try to explain himself unless asked first. </i>

204
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:10,660
<i> That's right, that's Sunbae's way. </i>

205
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,060
<i> Like Sunbae said, let's forget the past. </i>

206
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,620
<i> Let's forget everything and start anew. </i>

207
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,930
<i> That's how it should be. </i>

208
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,060
Excuse me.

209
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,290
Did you go home well yesterday?

210
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:52,250
Aigoo, who is this? Isn't it Yoo Jeong's girlfriend?

211
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,270
Your face look bright today. Did something good happen?

212
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,620
About yesterday, I'm so—

213
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,610
You're diligent, you're never late and even come early.

214
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,260
Of course, Yoo Jeong's girlfriend is different.

215
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,000
Study well.

216
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,420
What's this?!

217
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,210
Hey, are you going home?

218
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,620
Leave first, I will go home after you.

219
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,200
If your boyfriend knew we were together, he'd really hate it.

220
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,820
The same neighborhood of all places?

221
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,820
That's right. Your boyfriend would also really hate us doing this now. So go, hurry go.

222
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,880
He didn't come today? Your boyfriend didn't come today?

223
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,060
Excuse me. Why do you keep picking fights with me?

224
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,770
What? When did I pick a fight with you?

225
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,770
What are you so unhappy about?

226
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:50,850
If you have something to say, then just say it. And stop picking fights.

227
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,930
Something to say?

228
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,390
Okay, I should say it. From now on, let's pretend we don't know each other.

229
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:57,790
You are not comfortable about it either.

230
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,040
How do you feel? Aren't you really glad? Aren't you totally thankful I brought it up first?

231
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,300
Yes! I'm totally thankful!

232
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,990
Your words sure are pretty.

233
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,330
You said they're setting up a restaurant soon, didn't you?

234
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,590
Yes, a noodle restaurant.

235
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:23,020
I went yesterday and the interior was pretty good.

236
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,580
It's roomy. You should go there sometime. My mom's noodles are really delicious.

237
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,230
That's a bit... Isn't it too early for the meeting of the families?

238
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,410
What?

239
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:36,030
What is this?!

240
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:38,500
Don't do that.

241
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,320
That wasn't funny?

242
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,440
I wanted to make you laugh.

243
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,480
Ah. No, it was funny.

244
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,960
Tomorrow night I'll buy you dinner.

245
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:55,150
<i>What do you want to eat? I'll buy anything you want.</i>

246
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:58,650
I'm a woman who got paid.

247
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:04,170
Then I can eat something extremely expensive, right? Like a full course or something.

248
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,460
Ah, so funny. You're joking again.

249
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,170
You can stop now.

250
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,010
I get it.

251
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,660
I was joking too.

252
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,800
I got it. We'll eat whatever you want.

253
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,090
No, let's eat what you want.

254
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,350
Let's eat anything then.

255
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,760
Sunbae, I was joking.

256
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,660
He expects to study in a place like this?

257
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,010
Look at the clothes he took off.

258
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,440
Aigoo.

259
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,840
He's drinking instead of studying.

260
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,160
Honey, you're home?

261
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,680
Where were you and what were you doing?

262
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:33,720
My middle school alumnus came, so I just met him briefly out front.

263
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:38,430
Middle school alumnus? Who?

264
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,910
You know... From back then...

265
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:41,910
Who?

266
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,190
Why are you always lying?

267
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,520
My mom really missed me.

268
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,080
I went to see my mom for a bit before my father woke up.

269
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,520
Then go to your mother.

270
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,860
Go eat and live well.

271
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,270
Yoon Seob, why would you say that?

272
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,540
How can you just leave? Talk to me before leaving, huh?

273
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,360
- Eat breakfast and then go.<br>- Eat by yourself.

274
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,440
No, you should eat breakfast and then go. Even so...

275
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,040
Ahjusshi, Ahjusshi.

276
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,290
Excuse me.

277
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,870
Who is it?

278
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:18,490
He's the landlord's grandson. What are you doing here?

279
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,500
Ah, hello.

280
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,890
I was exercising this morning and remembered the window I fixed for you.

281
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,500
So I thought I'd check if it was okay.

282
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
At this hour?

283
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,800
Yes.

284
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,910
But are you two living together?

285
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,330
Whether we live together or not, what's it to you?

286
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,990
Ah, nothing. That's that.

287
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:48,910
But, please don't come too often. The contract for this place is for one person alone.

288
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:50,850
Yes, then.

289
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,510
Wait, this person...

290
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,370
- I'm sorry.<br> <i>- If you're giving them money, then why? Huh?</i>

291
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:59,090
- Don't you pay?<br>- Come inside.

292
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,840
Who is that guy?

293
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,400
- The landlord's grandson, I said.<br>- Why did he come at this hour?

294
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,810
Why so serious?

295
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:14,480
Since it's the first time I'm buying, I want to get something good.

296
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,480
Ah a coupon?

297
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,040
Ah, I know. What is it this time?

298
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,010
Today it's this.

299
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,240
<i>Special Summer Vacation Student Discount <br> 40% off ₩43,200</i>

300
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
We can eat this then.

301
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,770
- Really? <br> - Yes.

302
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,190
Excuse me.

303
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,300
I thought you'd be concerned, so I want to tell you this.

304
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,400
Don't worry too much because I don't talk to Baek In Ho much these days.

305
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,340
If something happens, tell me right away.

306
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,580
How did you become friends with Bo Ra and Eun Taek?

307
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:12,220
I got to know Eun Taek through Bo Ra.

308
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:15,580
I met Bo Ra in high school in my junior year.

309
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,490
At first, I was a little scared of her because she was so aggressive.

310
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,590
But as we got closer, we talked really easily.

311
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,640
When I think about it, there are people who are just like their first impression.

312
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,480
And there are people who are completely the opposite.

313
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,620
How about me?

314
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,640
We weren't like this last year.

315
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,650
After spending time with me, what do you think?

316
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,900
I like it.

317
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,000
That's how it is for me.

318
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:05,320
M-Me too.

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,260
The motorcycle.

323
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:23,570
Ah, I'm sorry.

324
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:26,100
No, no, it's okay.

325
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:29,940
♫ <i>Please hold my hand ♫</i>

326
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,910
- Sunbae, what are you looking at?<br>- Oh, a watch.

327
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:41,790
So you like watches. You always wear the same one, so I didn't know.

328
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,110
♫ <i> I am not just saying these words ♫</i>

329
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,380
That's pretty.

330
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,160
♫ <i>Oh what shall we do? ♫</i>

331
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,150
Oh, hey, Seol, this looks just like you. Look at this.

332
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,700
I don't think it's the same.

333
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,530
I think it looks the same. With curly red hair.

334
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,810
Let's each get one.

335
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,870
I'll buy that for you too.

336
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:19,050
Does it really resemble me?

337
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,840
Well, it does a little bit.

338
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,180
<i>Today, as well, I just received.</i>

339
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,520
That watch, earlier.

340
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,190
I want to buy it for him.

341
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,200
<i>Sunbae, did you get back okay?</i>

342
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,540
<i>Yeah, I got back okay.</i>

343
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,100
<i>What about you?</i>

344
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,380
<i>Am I at home? Or not?</i>

345
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:38,330
<i>I almost sent it.</i>

346
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:55,370
So cute.

347
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,450
<i>I spent all my money.</i>

348
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,930
<i>I said I spent all my money. Are you ignoring my calls?</i>

349
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,840
<i>I said that it looks like your sister is about to starve to death, you punk.</i>

350
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,280
<i>And you call yourself my brother?</i>

351
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,080
Who studies while walking?

352
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,390
And even while drinking water. Is that okay?

353
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:36,530
That's why English is a problem in our country.

354
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:40,100
No matter how well you speak, will you become a Korean-American?

355
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,220
You said to pretend we don't know each other.

356
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,230
Do I know you?

357
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,480
I'm cleaning, so can you please move?

358
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,330
Wait, wait a minute.

359
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,860
No, I didn't do it on purpose.

360
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,670
Did it get very wet?

361
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,950
Hey Dog fur, are you mad?

362
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,310
You're not being cute at all!

363
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:18,990
What are those two doing?

364
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,970
Pay for these with yours.

365
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,480
Who are you?

366
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,630
My sugar level is dropping, so let me quickly settle the bill.

367
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,280
- Can you really shine shoes well?<br>- Yes, of course.

368
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:46,720
I'm not sure about this...

369
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,160
Okay, take the shoes.

370
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:55,110
Ah, do I have to give this to you or not?

371
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,550
You should give it to me. Since I told you I'd shine your shoes.

372
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:01,270
Here. But, you better only copy it once.

373
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,800
- Yes<br>- I'm going to watch you.

374
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,640
Thank you.

375
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,180
<i> Hey, hey! You better not run off with those shoes, they're expensive!</i>

376
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,720
- I won't run off!<br>- They're expensive!

377
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,320
I got it.

378
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,520
Let's see...

379
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,470
Hey Dog fur.

380
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:35,490
As a matter of fact, if you knew what I was doing for you, you'd be shocked.

381
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,300
As if.

382
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,200
- Baek In Ha? <br> - Aigoo, my Dongsaeng.

383
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,080
Were you really scared because your sister said some mean things?

384
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,710
Where are you right now?

385
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:50,000
Where else would I be? I'm in front of your work.

386
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,260
Hurry up and prepare what I texted you and come out, or else

387
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,240
I don't know what's going to happen to your pretty girlfriend.

388
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,250
Hey, HEY!

389
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,750
Aigoo, seriously!

390
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,310
I used it well. Thanks to you, my brother is going to come right out.

391
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,790
- I'll be going.<br>- Where are you going?

392
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,390
But what is your relationship with my brother?

393
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:20,520
He is not the type who'd be nice to just anyone.

394
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,610
It's not the relationship you're thinking of.

395
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,670
Baek In Ho and I just know each other.

396
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:30,280
Oh... You just know each other?

397
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,510
Yes. Enough to greet each other when we come and go.

398
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,740
- Oh, if it's enough to greet each other when you come and go— You can't.<br>- You can't. Baek In Ha!

399
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,920
- then he came too fast. Too fast.<br> - Hey! Hey!

400
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,250
So noisy, so noisy.

401
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,910
Did you get hit?

402
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:46,990
Take this and go back. Return it to Instructor Baek after copying it.

403
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,820
Follow me while I'm speaking nicely.

404
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,340
Come here!

405
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,480
Come see me! Follow me!

406
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,590
Please save me!

407
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,000
- Be quiet!<br>- Let go!

408
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,710
Are you crazy?

409
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,300
Have you lost it? Why mess with her?

410
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,650
Crazy punk. Like you say, have you lost it?

411
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,200
You think you can date in the state you're in? She would be weird to do so.

412
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,950
Quit talking nonsense. Talking about dating...

413
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:19,010
I don't care. Just give me money. It's urgent.

414
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,460
Did you cause more trouble?

415
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:23,900
Causing trouble when I simply borrowed her cellphone?

416
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:27,650
But it is in your name.

417
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:29,670
You seriously!

418
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,550
Why?

419
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:38,370
Do you want to hit me?

420
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,560
Then hit me.

421
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,710
Because you're just like our aunt anyway.

422
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,790
- You. <br> - Hit me.

423
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:50,020
<i>Hit me, you crazy Aunt!</i>

424
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,210
<i>- Where do you get off...<br>- Aunt!</i>

425
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:53,540
<i>No, I didn't!</i>

426
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,060
<i>Come here!</i>

427
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,990
<i>Stop right there!</i>

428
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,620
<i>Open up!</i>

429
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,270
<i>Are you crazy? Why make her mad and let her beat you?</i>

430
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,410
<i>That kind of woman isn't our aunt!</i>

431
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,540
<i>I'm going to open the door!</i>

432
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:11,230
<i>Let's report her. That kind of woman needs to be put in jail!</i>

433
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:15,990
<i>If we report her, where will we live? We don't have a mom and dad. And grandfather died.</i>

434
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,020
<i>Don't you know we'll become beggars?</i>

435
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,490
<i>But still, I can't live here!</i>

436
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,510
<i>If you don't open this door on your own,..</i>

437
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,940
What are you doing?

438
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,790
<i>Aunt is going to steal us.</i>

439
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:35,510
<i>She's going to kill us. Now there's nothing else we can do but to run away.</i>

440
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:42,590
<i>Hey dummy! If you go out that way, you'll get caught!</i>

441
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:45,260
Aish, follow me.

442
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,890
<i>Be careful coming down.</i>

443
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:54,470
<i>Stop right there!</i>

444
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:57,220
<i>In Ho! Take me! In Ho!</i>

445
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,660
<i>Why are you going by yourself?</i>

446
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,590
<i>Come here!</i>

447
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,280
<i>Come here.</i>

448
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,490
<i>Stop right there!</i>

449
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,840
<i>In Ho. In Ho, what happened?</i>

450
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,270
<i>Hey!</i>

451
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:16,230
<i>Take me with you! You can't go by yourself!</i>

452
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:19,630
<i>Ahjusshi!</i>

453
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,890
<i>Take me with you. When grandfather died,</i>

454
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,920
<i>- How dare you bite your aunt? <br> - Please look at this!</i>

455
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,680
<i>That woman did this!</i>

456
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,830
<i>-I... Stand right there!<br>- Ahjusshi!</i>

457
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,860
<i>Please take me with you! Take me with you!</i>

458
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:37,560
<i>That woman is evil!</i>

459
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,730
If I act a little pitiful, money comes out.

460
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,890
You pathetic punk.

461
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,740
Still feeling that guilt.

462
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:20,610
I used the notebook well and returned it.

463
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,530
Thank you.

464
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:26,290
Just say we're even.

465
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,710
Now I can live.

466
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,220
Hello.

467
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,790
- Please come often. <br> - Yeah, thank you.

468
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,570
Hey, Owner Hong,

469
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,090
The apron suits you.

470
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:02,910
Take this over there. Over there.

471
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,370
- A yogurt drink.<br>- Thank you.

472
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,470
See you again!

473
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,760
Apron...

474
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,480
Please enjoy.

475
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,320
Where are you going?

476
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,180
It's so busy I could die.

477
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,230
He'll probably be back soon.

478
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,340
What's with your father?

479
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,790
What's so embarrassing about having a restaurant?

480
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,200
You should know by now how stubborn he is.

481
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,770
He'll be better about it in time. Just give me one rice cake.

482
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,330
I'd like it if he resembled you by even half.

483
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,760
Hey Seol, when you get a chance, call Joon for me.

484
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,080
He's been going crazy the past few days wanting to come back to Seoul after hearing about opening the restaurant.

485
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,530
He doesn't think of studying.

486
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,660
That's what I'm saying.

487
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:02,530
Hello?

488
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:03,760
<i>Are you sleeping?</i>

489
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,970
I was helping at the restaurant all weekend.

490
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,330
You must be really tired.

491
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:13,630
Let's see a movie next time. I'll go to your neighborhood.

492
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,840
Is that so?

493
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:19,470
There's a place called Alley Tent in front of my home.

494
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,890
Alley Tent?

495
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,150
Yes, I'll go right there.

496
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:40,220
-...leave a message at the beep...<br>- Oh, lord,

497
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:43,230
Aunt, give me one more bottle of soju please.

498
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:49,560
You're drinking every day. How are you going to pass your exam?

499
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,520
Hey, I'll pass this time around. After I drink this one bottle, I'll be sure to pass!

500
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,530
Yoo Jeong?

501
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,090
Yes, I'm Gong Joo Yong

502
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,380
Joo Yong?

503
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:10,040
It really has been a while, let's drink together.

504
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,530
Let's have a drink together.

505
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,080
Wow, it's been a really long time.

506
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:20,590
So since you've been in college, I've barely seen you.

507
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:22,460
It's totally nice to see you.

508
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,020
What's with how you look?

509
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:30,780
I was kicked out by my family who opposed whom I was dating.

510
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,400
You left home over dating?

511
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,150
That's how it turned out.

512
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,560
But what can I do? There's nobody else who likes me unconditionally.

513
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,460
Hyung. Get your act together and go back to your family.

514
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,330
Hey, do you know anything about love?

515
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,310
You only played around with good looking kids.

516
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:54,700
I suppose, how can anyone with deep thoughts hang around people like you?

517
00:41:55,410 --> 00:42:02,310
I mean, that is, Jeong, that's not it. I'm not saying you did anything wrong.

518
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,890
Oh, I must be drunk. Just forget everything I said.

519
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,550
You're not going to get mad, are you?

520
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:10,650
I think you're really drunk. Let's go.

521
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:15,110
No, no, no. If you can, just buy me a drink.

522
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:19,220
Let's have just one more bottle. Just one, really.

523
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,950
Seol Hong, what brings you here?

524
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:27,390
He lives next door to me, and the way he normally speaks is a bit...

525
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,790
How are the two of you together?

526
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:35,260
What's going on? Do you two know each other?

527
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,770
Are you two dating?

528
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:55,730
There are a lot of weird punks these days.

529
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,010
Where is he going to use that brick?

530
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,250
That's the direction of Dog Fur's house, though.

531
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:09,390
I don't know...

532
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:21,350
Sheesh, not answering the phone.

533
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:28,580
I should have come out sooner...

534
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,500
Uh this pervert.

535
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:37,430
Is there nobody else to live with?

536
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,830
I'm going to go crazy? It's probably nothing.

537
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,970
Omo.

538
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,360
Hey you, hang in there, hey.

539
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:58,000
- Oh...<br>- Oh! Ahhhhh!

540
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,370
Please report this. Report this. So noisy!

541
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,980
- All this blood.<br><i>- This is the alley in front of the Sinil School. A person has collapsed.</i>

542
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,630
- Report it! Report it!<br><i>- Please come quickly.</i>

543
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,350
<i>Yes, hurry!</i>

544
00:44:14,350 --> 00:44:24,020
I was abandoned. In a word, I feel like I was dumped.

545
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:28,840
Hyung.

546
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,980
How...

547
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:33,240
Let's go home.

548
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,700
The door.

549
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:45,020
This man.

550
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,890
He didn't even lock the door. Wait a moment.

551
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:53,910
Careful, careful.

552
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,860
Ohhh...

553
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,140
Let's go.

554
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,110
The key...

555
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,630
What?

556
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,600
The key...

557
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:31,790
What?

558
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,320
<i>What am I supposed to do at times like this?</i>

559
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,900
<i>Do I have to invite him in for a moment? For coffee or ramen?</i>

560
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,130
<i>No, that's weird. That's weird. Think first.</i>

561
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,630
I'd like to do that also, but next time.

562
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,280
Sleep well. And lock up safely.

563
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,890
I was showering not long ago, and he was looking at me through the window.

564
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,840
Who are you calling a pervert?

565
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,730
-He seems like a pervert.<br>-Yes, I understand.

566
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:34,940
So, please tell me what you were doing and where you were at between 21:00-24:00.

567
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:38,920
I'm glad you came! I was drinking with this young lady. We were drinking together, weren't we?

568
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,620
Yes, that's right.

569
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,830
Really?

570
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,090
But, not just this incident, but lately in this neighborhood, there is underwear missing.

571
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,460
Pardon me, but I'm going to have to look through your house.

572
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,550
Please go, please dig through everything.

573
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:53,410
Sweetie, you're not busy, are you? Could you come with me? Thanks.

574
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,880
A pervert like you has to go to jail for you to get your act straight!

575
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,660
Don't make me laugh! I'd never look at yours.

576
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:01,560
I should move or something. I said there isn't anything!

577
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:03,710
Yes, yes. Just a moment. I'll just take a look.

578
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,590
Isn't that woman crazy? What is she saying I stole a look at?

579
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:12,430
It's so frustrating.

580
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,770
What is this?!

581
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:17,280
Gosh.

582
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,410
What is all this?

583
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:22,140
This isn't mine! I didn't do this!

584
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,020
Yes, this ahjusshi isn't such a person.

585
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,950
Yes, yes, what? Is yours here, too?

586
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:33,280
That is, is it just similar?

587
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,960
Similar? What's similar? I didn't do this, someone put it here! Really!

588
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,410
Yes, yes, since the evidence appeared, let's go and talk.

589
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:43,000
No!

590
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,830
Gong Joo Yong.

591
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:54,010
Yes, Sunbae. I was about to call you anyway. I'm at the police station.

592
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:56,260
The police station? Why are you there?

593
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,950
I'm preparing for the civil service exam.

594
00:47:57,950 --> 00:47:59,430
Lately, in my neighborhood, there's something going on with undergarments.

595
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:01,190
<i>Last night, from 20:00 to 24:00,</i>

596
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:06,070
The women's underwear was in his house.

597
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:07,510
From Joo Yong's house?

598
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,340
He says it isn't him, but what can be done?

599
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,460
There's nothing that can be done if the clothes were at the scene.

600
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,550
If he really isn't the criminal, he'll be released soon. Don't worry.

601
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,920
<i>Didn't he say the two of them were close?</i>

602
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:22,760
The victim that was struck is our Yoon Seob?

603
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:27,250
Where are you going?! Hey!

604
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,310
If you leave like that, you'll be in more trouble!

605
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:31,510
<i>What is it?</i>

606
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,140
What is happening?

607
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:47,720
The next door man and Teacher Heo.

608
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:53,160
- Oh?<br>- What is she doing there?

609
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,990
I reported it for nothing and get mistaken for the attacker.

610
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:01,460
This is why they say nothing good comes from helping a stranger. Do you know that?

611
00:49:02,810 --> 00:49:07,290
But still, the person you rescued is a teacher in my major.

612
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,880
You did a good thing.

613
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,860
So, is he okay?

614
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:18,720
Fortunately, he's okay. But why was he there? My teacher.

615
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,160
But why were you in front of my house?

616
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,700
Huh?

617
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,480
I didn't go to the front of your house on purpose.

618
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,640
I was chasing the punk with the brick and ended up... why would I go there? Geez.

619
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,090
What a strange girl.

620
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,110
Why are you getting so flustered? Who said anything?

621
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:47,430
No. You didn't say anything.

622
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,360
Anyway, thank you.

623
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,980
If you're thankful, then buy me a meal.

624
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,460
Ah, and also, sorry about my sister. In the future, if you see my sister,

625
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,500
just run. I'm going.

626
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:14,940
What is that about? Does that make sense?

627
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,610
Am I supposed to believe that?

628
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:18,770
Is he back?

629
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:23,490
You're not studying. And you don't answer my calls.

630
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,220
And getting into a situation like this?

631
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:28,720
Don't get mad. If you get mad, you'll make the blood go to your head.

632
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,650
Is that the problem right now?

633
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,630
- Where are you going? <br> - Let go.

634
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,220
Honey.

635
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,560
I was just wondering if you were okay.

636
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,980
You, what brings you here?

637
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:49,040
I live right next door.

638
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,080
Oh, these kids...

639
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:56,060
Hey, is it fun for the two of you to play with my weaknesses?

640
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,520
Isn't it nice going to school for free these days?

641
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:04,460
He gave his scholarship to you and got you a job at the department. Your life is beautiful, isn't it?

642
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,940
Eh?

643
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,400
You really don't know?

644
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,190
Yoo Jeong bastard threatened me to discard his report so you would get the scholarship!

645
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:20,920
What are you talking about? The rich kid who threatened you was Yoo Jeong?

646
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,990
Don't you know?

647
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,200
Huh? Don't you know?

648
00:51:36,110 --> 00:51:39,910
Yeah, Seol. I was on my way there anyway.

649
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:45,210
Okay. Then I'll go that way.

650
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,560
Seol.

651
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,060
What's wrong?

652
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,260
Why did you hang up so suddenly earlier?

653
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,440
Did something happen?

654
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,040
Sunbae,

655
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,690
Teacher Heo losing that report,

656
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:24,740
he said that you asked him to deliberately do that so that I could get the scholarship.

657
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:27,630
Is that true?

658
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,520
Yes.

659
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,320
Why?

660
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,080
Because I didn't want you to take a year off.

661
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:43,340
But that was when we weren't even talking to each other.

662
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,700
I wanted to get close to you.

663
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:51,110
Like you said, we weren't even talking then.

664
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,990
And there were misunderstandings between us. And I heard about your year off.

665
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:00,910
I wanted to help you but didn't have a way to.

666
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:05,910
So I gave up my scholarship.

667
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:16,130
You wanted to get close to me.

668
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,990
You wanted to clear up the misunderstanding.

669
00:53:20,890 --> 00:53:23,410
So all semester Teacher Heo

670
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:27,610
was known as a useless teacher who lost a student's report.

671
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:32,070
I became the student who received the scholarship unjustly.

672
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:36,390
And not knowing that, I smiled in front of Teacher Heo and you.

673
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:38,210
And he just resented and disliked me.

674
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,090
I don't think that Teacher Heo was victimized.

675
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:47,130
He had done something wrong towards me, and I just asked him to lose the report in return for that.

676
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,190
That's how we settled and ended it.

677
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,860
You are saying you ended it?

678
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,860
Yeah, it's all over with.

679
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:59,280
Seol, let's not fight over things that already happened.

680
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:05,960
How is everything always so clear and simple for you?

681
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,020
I told you everything.

682
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,480
Teacher Heo is still being badmouthed by the students.

683
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,460
And he hates me.

684
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:17,390
Have you ever thought about it from Teacher Heo's perspective?

685
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:22,230
I'm sorry for being short-sighted.

686
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,390
However, at least...

687
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,720
just know that I did it for your sake.

688
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:30,940
I'd like if you would know that.

689
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,020
I'm sorry, but I'll get going first.

690
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:39,500
<i>I'm going to go crazy because my pride is hurt.</i>

691
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:44,340
<i>And I'm suffocating at the thought that someone became a victim because of me.</i>

692
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,260
I can't really say

693
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,240
that I'm thankful.

694
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:54,250
<i>Because I don't want to get used to taking what belongs to others.</i>

695
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,690
<i>Without realizing it, I was always receiving from Sunbae.</i>

696
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,870
<i>And the thing that makes me the maddest,</i>

697
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:05,150
<i>is myself for being shaken by his words that it was for my sake.</i>

698
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,920
<i>She told me to tell her the truth,</i>

699
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,940
<i>so I did that.</i>

700
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,460
Teacher Heo,

701
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:34,460
where are you?

702
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:38,220
<i>6 months ago at the end of semester party</i>

703
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,880
<i>Why do you carry this?</i>

704
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:49,570
<i>I heard the food tastes great.</i>

705
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,920
<i>That's nonsense!</i>

706
00:55:55,990 --> 00:56:03,020
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ viki. com </i>

707
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,210
<i>Please throw away my report.</i>

708
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:09,910
<i>Why would I throw away a perfectly good report?</i>

709
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:13,070
<i>Please throw it away before it is graded.</i>

710
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:17,000
<i>- If it's processed as a zero, you're not getting the scholarship?</i>

711
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,410
Yes.

712
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:22,120
<i>Then let's say I throw away the report,</i>

713
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,730
<i>what am I supposed to tell the professor?</i>

714
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:29,190
<i>Are you telling me to take the blame? Do you think I'd do that?</i>

715
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,900
<i>I think you'll do that for me.</i>

716
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,340
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

717
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,070
<i>If you did wrong, you should at least pay the price.</i>

718
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,460
<i>Let's call it even after this.</i>

719
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,910
Yoo Jeong is a really scary kid.

720
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:47,310
If he thinks he's been fooled, then he'll pay back exactly how he got it.

721
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,820
Now what do we do?

722
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:52,010
If he starts a rumor,

723
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:54,240
I'm going to find him and either live or die.

724
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,850
There should be a limit to being stupid.

725
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,530
Yoo Jeong.

726
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:04,430
Who's talking big when they're the one who did wrong?

727
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:08,380
We clearly agreed that it never happened, but if you start acting like this,

728
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:12,070
what should I do?

729
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,880
Oh, Jeong. Don't get worked up. Let's talk it out.

730
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,450
Yoon Seob isn't feeling like himself. He hurt his head badly, you see.

731
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,890
Why?

732
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:23,900
What, What?

733
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,670
- Stop it, Hyung. <br> - What?

734
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,760
Stop it! Don't do it!

735
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,130
Go and tell them!

736
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,110
Even if his words are annoying, he's a really good person.

737
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:35,910
Why are you saying that to him? I can just fire her!

738
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,110
Honey.

739
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:39,150
What are you both?

740
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:43,060
What a sight...

741
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,190
One person is a credit card thief, and one person is an undergarment thief.

742
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,510
Do your parents know you are doing this?

743
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,260
Yoon Seob had done all that because of me.

744
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:57,360
And those undergarments, I really don't know anything about.

745
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:00,270
That's unknown until your charge is dropped.

746
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:04,590
I knew it, this is Yoo Jeong.

747
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:09,370
You don't understand anyone's feelings and disregard them. And you step on anyone who gets in your way.

748
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:12,710
You've become worse than before.

749
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:14,410
Are you saying it's all because of me?

750
00:58:14,410 --> 00:58:16,350
He ruined everything!

751
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:18,000
Hyung, too.

752
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,980
And my situation, too!

753
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:23,490
How could you tell Seol—

754
00:58:23,490 --> 00:58:26,160
Hyung! Hyung! Hyung! Sorry, sorry!

755
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,450
I was wrong. I'll apologize! I'll kneel and beg.

756
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:33,260
I'll beg like this. So overlook it this once for Yoon Seob.

757
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,960
He is really to be pitied.

758
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,070
He's given up a lot for me! Let it slide this once!

759
00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,060
- Let's go. <br>- I'm okay, Honey.<br>- Let's stop.<br>- It's okay!

760
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:45,030
- Get up.<br>- Jeong, please let it go this once!

761
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,070
Please stop it.

762
00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:49,940
Fine, I'll let it go.

763
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,890
But in return, go back to your family

764
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,120
because I don't like seeing you be like this near Seol.

765
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,040
Jeong, then I...

766
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,770
So should I tell your family

767
00:59:01,770 --> 00:59:03,780
what circumstances you're in?

768
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,100
Hyung.

769
00:59:10,730 --> 00:59:12,530
Be careful.

770
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,340
Joo Yong, are you going to go home?

771
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:28,220
Huh? Are you going to go to your family?

772
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,790
This is a really long day.

773
00:59:33,790 --> 00:59:34,790
Isn't it, Honey?

774
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,550
So are you going to go back home?

775
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,540
I'm asking if you're going back home?

776
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:49,050
Let's not get angry today.

777
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:05,820
<i>You haven't changed at all.</i>

778
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:10,200
<i>You don't understand anyone's feelings and disregard them. And you step on anyone who gets in your way.</i>

779
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:14,400
<i>How is everything always so clear and simple for you?</i>

780
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:21,740
<i>Am I strange? My ways, my thinking.</i>

781
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,640
<i>Why? What?</i>

782
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:31,930
<i>Yoo Jeong, I did wrong. I was really desperate!</i>

783
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:36,010
<i>You don't see anything because everyone always says you're kind and adores you and treats you well, huh?</i>

784
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,190
<i>I didn't know it would go this far.</i>

785
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:40,850
<i>So couldn't you let it go this once, huh, Sunbae?</i>

786
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:45,770
<i>What's so great about you that you look down on everyone from above?</i>

787
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:52,270
<i>The one who is really strange isn't me, but it's all of you.</i>

788
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,300
<i>No, it's okay, I'll do it.</i>

789
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,340
<i>No, oohhhh!</i>

790
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:06,410
<i>You did it too. You caught me and sneered at me.</i>

791
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:16,350
<i>You judged me and avoided me.</i>

792
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,570
<i>Seol,</i>

793
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,260
<i>I'm not strange.</i>

794

<i>Why are you stuck here?</i>

798
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,950
<i>Did you two fight? You should kiss when you happily see each other.</i>

01:02:13,150 --> 01:02:15,070
<i>Why would he have sent me to you?</i>

809
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,880

815
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:31,640
