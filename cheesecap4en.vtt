<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ chiblitokyo </i>

2
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,590
<i>Cheese in the Trap</i>

3
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,710
Thank you for walking me home. We are here

4
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,500
Thank you for bringing me home.

5
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,890
Then, I'll be going..

6
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,740
Seol.

7
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,810
Yes?

8
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:30,480
Do you want to go out with me?

9
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,910
Your answer is?

10
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,740
I don't know why you're saying this, so suddenly...

11
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,110
You really don't know?

12
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:53,950
Yes. And I don't have any intention yet of trying to date a boyfriend.

13
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,090
Really?

14
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,430
No, no, it's not like that. Sunbae, it's not that I don't like you.

15
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,920
It's just that...

16
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,810
Then let's date.

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,650
I think it'll be fine then.

18
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,060
Let's do it... Hmm?

19
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,080
Y-Yes.

20
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,170
I'm happy.

21
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,840
It's late. Go inside.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,230
Yes.

23
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:13,930
No way.

24
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,970
It doesn't make sense.

25
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,980
Back to basics with English...

26
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,720
This makes no sense! Crazy!

27
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,580
It makes no sense! Crazy! Crazy! Crazy!

28
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,930
<i>It's crazy!</i>

29
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,690
I can't.

30
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,150
Today I didn't even drink.

31
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,600
What is going on...?

32
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,520
It makes no sense. It's unimaginable.

33
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,970
It's not real. What is Sunbae lacking to date me?

34
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,930
No way. No way. Because he actually likes me?

35
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:08,830
<i>Yeah, there is no evidence that he has liked you up until now...</i>

36
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,600
<i>But really, would he have asked to date you if he didn't like you?</i>

37
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,430
<i>Think about what happened last year! Are you going to ignore the put-downs?</i>

38
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,310
<i>And suddenly he says he like you? He's got some ulterior motive.</i>

39
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,020
<i>You're right...</i>

40
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,290
<i>It's suspicious.</i>

41
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:29,090
<i>Why did you nod your head?</i>

42
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,610
<i>That's what I say.</i>

43
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,360
<i>Why on earth did I do it?</i>

44
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,790
<i>Episode 4</i>

45
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,010
How do I look at Sunbae's face?

46
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,460
I'm going to talk to the kids again. Yeah.

47
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,080
Oh, it's break!

48
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,920
That's right. It's break now!

49
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,370
He'll be busy.

50
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,950
Thank goodness.

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,420
It's vacation!

52
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:42,190
What should I do? What do I do if I run into him?

53
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,090
<i>If he makes it obvious in front of the others, it will be awkward.</i>

54
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:50,980
S-Seon...

55
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,170
Hong Seol. Hi!

56
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,220
- Yoo Jeong...let's go! <br>- Yeah.

57
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,890
S-Sunbae!

58
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,490
Hi!

59
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,780
What do you want to eat? Oh...so hungry!

60
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,930
- I'm hungry. <br>- What shall we eat?

61
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,970
<i>What was that? Did he really ask to date me?</i>

62
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,420
<i>I wasn't expecting anything special,</i>

63
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,980
<i>but still, this wasn't it.</i>

64
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,590
<i>What is it? Does he regret it? That's what I should be doing.</i>

65
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,120
That's right, you should put in some effort.

66
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:28,330
Sorry.

67
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,500
GPA is 4.3. That's a given these days.

68
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,220
There are no extra-curricular activities (internet, etc).

69
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,090
TOEIC 830

70
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:41,030
Does this meet graduaton standards? No grades for "speaking".

71
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,910
Yes, I have yet to do the "speaking" part.

72
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,960
What is this? What company and what area will you be going to once you graduate?

73
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,300
Student, why did you come into business administration?

74
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,310
Student, what is your real dream?

75
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,350
<i>Dream? What dream?</i>

76
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,730
<i>Even if I wanted to dream, I don't have the money for tutoring.</i>

77
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,220
<i>Are the tutoring fees the issue?</i>

78
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,140
<i>I have to resolve getting tuition for next term.</i>

79
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:14,630
<i>It's already too late for a scholarship.</i>

80
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:18,170
<i>Do I have to take another term off?</i>

81
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,020
You can't get a scholarship? Why not?

82
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,980
In one course, my grades weren't very good.

83
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,070
So maybe Mom you could help just a little this time?

84
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,990
Good job.

85
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,020
You have the audacity to ask for money from home in this situation?

86
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,000
Who's the one who created this situation?

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,100
And have you ever helped pay for Seol's tuition?

88
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,930
What good is it pay all this money for a girl to go to school?

89
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:52,930
The man is supposed to set up the house.

90
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,540
That's what I'm saying! All that expensive money spent to put the men of this house through school.

91
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,400
They don't know anything!

92
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,170
Mom...

93
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,950
I've heard hot air countlessly.

94
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,320
What a billion times? Ten billion times?

95
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,900
Don't you dare even mention business again!

96
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,720
- If I mention it! What are you going to do if I do?

97
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,590
What do you know about business?!

98
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,010
It's because I have an unlucky woman next to me that even something that is supposed to work out well doesn't work!

99
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,920
Yelling after you lost all our money!

100
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,140
Mom... Is it possible, again?

101
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,490
Yeah. He lost it again!

102
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,310
Talking so big that it was going to work this time.

103
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,130
We don't even have the money for rent.

104
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,800
I will eat well.

105
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,780
How does it taste?

106
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,130
It's good!

107
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,530
That's good.

108
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,040
Do you think I could sell it?

109
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,970
You're going to sell noodles?

110
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,390
I have to at least do something.

111
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,830
We might end up on the streets if we keep this up.

112
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:01,160
You are you, too, but what do we do about Joon?

113
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,560
If he stubbornly sent his son to study abroad,

114
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,490
he should at least take responsibility for it!

115
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,210
He sends him because he wants to and now what am I supposed to do?

116
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,040
Say, Seol...

117
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,560
Can you move out of your rental?

118
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,370
To pay for Joon's school and your tuition,

119
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,370
let's try to make it work with it. It might be hard to commute,

120
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,820
but you can't take another term off.

121
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,110
Okay.

122
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,800
I didn't like it anyway.

123
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,920
Going up and down once tires my legs so much.

124
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,950
And the next door neighbor is so sensitive.

125
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,550
And the door is crap.

126
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,500
Yeah, it's for the better.

127
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:01,950
It was too small and cramped.

128
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,650
Too hot in summer and cold in winter.

129
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,280
The walls are crap.

130
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,000
Why did Mom only pack kimchi?

131
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,280
Sure, I'll commute 4 hours,

132
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,710
and get to eat mom's food.

133
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,950
It's a good thing.

134
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,680
I'm so relieved

135
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,960
But why isn't Sunbae contacting me?

136
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,930
Is everyone like this?

137
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:01,420
I don't know anything about this.

138
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,230
I should ask Ah Young.

139
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:09,640
Oh right, she went backpacking.

140
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,050
Okay, I don't know.

141
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:19,310
Whatever. Don't worry about it. When did you ever worry about things like this?

142
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,310
<i>I'll treat you guys since the exams are over.</i>

143
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,600
<i>It's going to be expensive, so don't cry about it if you miss out.</i>

144
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,740
Shall I casually reconnoiter?

145
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,730
What is this? This is so awkward. So frustrating.

146
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:49,280
Let's just act like we did before.

147
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,450
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:57,010
I didn't have time to relax then because I was too caught up with my grades and scholarships.

149
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:02,410
Actually talking about myself is uncomfortable and embarrassing.

150
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,830
I'll do better from now on. I'll tell you everything if something's wrong.

151
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,950
No, I wasn't saying that you had to tell me everything about yourself.

152
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:16,660
I just thought that we were the best of friends, but I didn't know anything about you.

153
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,510
And that made me really disappointed.

154
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,440
Bo Ra.

155
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,760
I'm sorry, Seol. I won't try to set you up as much from now on.

156
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,270
Instead, let's be a bit more honest with each other now.

157
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:37,500
I'll be more honest.

158
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,750
Seol!

159
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,650
My friend.

160
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,720
Enough with that. Hurry and take this.

161
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:50,330
I was so worried that I wouldn't be able to eat this after coming here.

162
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:54,640
Hey, you should've stacked the food like a mountain.

163
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,990
Hurry. Stop talking and eat a bunch.

164
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,830
Ah, let's eat.

165
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,160
Bon appétit.

166
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,490
I saw Sunbae Yoo Jeong at school today.

167
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,870
Where?

168
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,110
- Out front.<br>- Why did he come to school during break?

169
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,030
- Did he say anything to you?<br>- Nope.

170
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,930
Why do you ask, though? Do you have some business with him?

171
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,180
I don't.

172
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,070
Hey, Eun Taek. You witnessed it earlier, right?

173
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,060
You heard her holding my hand and saying, "I'll be more honest," to me, right?

174
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,310
Of course. It seems like she's trying. Let's wait a little longer.

175
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,320
Do you know anything about tutoring jobs?

176
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,580
Nope.

177
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,730
I have to go to get a part time job.

178
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:44,170
We're waiting. We're waiting.

179
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,480
That's...

180
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,120
So?

181
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,310
Sunbae Yoo Jeong asked me to date.

182
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:55,600
Stop saying weird things, hurry and tell us the truth!

183
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,350
Really!

184
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,780
I don't know why he suddenly did that,

185
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:02,550
but he asked me to date him and never contacted me after that.

186
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:07,320
I don't even know if I'm supposed to contact him first or not. Anyway, I'm saying it's odd.

187
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,220
What should I do?

188
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,100
See, I knew you guys wouldn't believe it.

189
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,720
I don't believe it either.

190
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,520
What's wrong?

191
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,930
See? I told you that there was something between those two. I—

192
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,490
Hey! Hurry and tell us from the start.

193
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,100
Stop eating, tell us what happened properly.

194
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,780
That's all.

195
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,340
What should I do?

196
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:30,740
Since when did Yoo Jeong start liking you?

197
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:34,750
The atmosphere between you two wasn't really good when you guys first met. This is amazing.

198
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,500
I wonder what Yoo Jeong found attractive about Hong.

199
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,880
No matter how I see it, she doesn't have any charms.

200
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,540
Hey. Why doesn't she have charm?

201
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,310
She's responsible. She's responsible...

202
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,490
- And also she's responsible? <br>- Yes she is.

203
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,200
That's right.

204
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,310
Then...

205
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,570
Who is it? Sunbae?

206
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,490
Hello?

207
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,620
<i>Are you going to take a part-time job?</i>

208
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,600
Teacher Assistant Heo?

209
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,950
An office assistant part-time job?

210
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,280
Are you going to do it or not? Decide now.

211
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,230
- But why are you suddenly...

212
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,370
Are you not going to do it? Don't go back on your words.

213
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,690
No, I'm going to do it. I'll do it.

214
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,650
<i>Mondays. Nine in the morning.</i>

215
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,950
Just try and be late to work.

216
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,110
She's going to do it. Gosh...

217
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,620
- What? Teaching Assistant Heo offered you a part time job? <br> - Yeah.

218
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,300
That's awesome.

219
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,590
It would be a total dream too, but how did this happen?

220
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:37,750
What is that? You have to be specially selected for that.

221
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,670
Why is he being like this only to you?

222
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:42,390
Teacher Assistant Heo must have thought well of Hong.

223
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,860
You're just jealous.

224
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,580
- I'm going. <br> - You're leaving?

225
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,830
Hey, just call Sunbae now.

226
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:53,970
Call him and tell him you'll do the part-time job and ask him about his break, too.

227
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,280
Dating is all about timing.

228
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,670
Just go for it. Okay?

229
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,550
If you're so good at dating, then why haven't you dated since going to college?

230
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,650
It's not because I can't, it's because I don't want to. Are you kidding me?

231
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,520
I'm telling you...

232
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,720
Noona, Hong is all set now,

233
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,060
so can we rehash what I talked about before?

234
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,940
I don't know! I'm not talking with an ugly guy.

235
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,830
I'm leaving.

236
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,150
Is it because I don't have any charm?

237
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,390
<i>During this break, I got a part-time job at the school.</i>

238
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,170
<i>What are you doing during the break?</i>

239
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,850
Send?

240
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,520
Send.

241
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,850
Don't Seol, don't...

242
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,490
One, two...

243
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:07,750
<i>Really, That's good.</i>

244
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,720
<i>Have a good break.</i>

245
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:15,750
Is he saying that we won't see each other during the break?

246
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,210
Why is dating like this?

247
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,110
<i>The break started.</i>

248
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,100
<i>Office work from 9 to 5.</i>

249
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,080
It's definitely a dream job... Except for one thing.

250
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,630
Hello.

251
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,340
Why are you so late?

252
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,320
I'm asking you why you're so late?

253
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,060
Come here.

254
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,640
Hurry!

255
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,380
Did I tell you to arrive 10 minutes early or not?

256
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,840
Do I look easy to you just because I'm still a teacher's assistant at this age?

257
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,140
Teacher Assistant Heo, why are you being like this?

258
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,920
It's not even 9 yet.

259
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,350
It's a given that she should've came earlier on her first day.

260
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:17,590
Hey, just go and wash the cups.

261
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,720
- Wash the cups. Stop looking at me and wash the cups. <br> - Yes.

262
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,750
Seol, your seat is here. Leave your bag there and then go wash the cups.

263
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,110
<i>Teacher Assistant Heo is weird.</i>

264
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,830
<i>I know he's very particular to begin with.</i>

265
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,330
Hello.

266
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:48,690
It's not even time yet, why are you so early?

267
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, so you must have a lot of time on your hands.

268
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,240
Then don't go home from now on. You got it?

269
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,950
You can just live here.

270
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:58,980
These need to be organized.

271
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,640
Sort them all in alphabetical order.

272
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,110
What are you doing? Hurry and sort them.

273
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,300
Thank you.

274
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,760
Tastes good.

275
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,920
How did you make this?

276
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,290
By your request, I made it dark.

277
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,340
But coffee is better iced.

278
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,610
Put a bunch of ice in it.

279
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,470
- You can't have cold things though.<br>- Yes I can.

280
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,320
I have ice in whatever I eat.

281
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,500
Eyyy. From earlier you were fussing and wailing that you had to go to the bathroom and had an upset stomach.

282
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,690
What are you talking about? Remake it. Thanks.

283
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,830
<i>It's only been a few days. I'm already tired of this.</i>

284
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,230
-<i> Sunbae never contacted me after...</i><br>- What are you...

285
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,610
Why are you using your cellphone?

286
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:11,470
Ah! Is there something else you want me to do?

287
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,500
If someone heard this, they'd think that I always order you around.

288
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,070
You should put it away because you came to work.

289
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,600
<i>Jeong! It's break, what are you doing here?</i>

290
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:22,650
Sunbae.

291
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,980
You came here to work so you shouldn't take out your cell phone. You need to put it away.

292
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,560
Jeong, why are you at school when it's the break?

293
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,630
- Hi. <br> - Sunbae.

294
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,050
- Why are you here?<br>- I came to see Seol for a moment.

295
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,360
Seol?

296
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,760
What is this? Are you guys dating or what?

297
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,910
Are you guys dating?

298
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,780
- Yes.<br>- Awesome. Really? Oh my gosh.

299
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,650
- <i>I'm so jealous.</i><br>- Are you working hard? <br> - Yes

300
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,900
-Oh, right. Have some of this while you work.<br>-Thank you.

301
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,280
- Seol can leave for a moment, right? <br> - Yes.

302
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,480
Yeah, go ahead.

303
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,630
Go on out.

304
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,990
I'll be back soon.

305
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:18,270
Oh and thank you for everything, Teacher Assistant Heo.

306
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,580
It's nothing to make a big deal over.

307
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,130
I'm taking classes during the semester break. I'll come by often.

308
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,270
See you.

309
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,270
- Take your time, Seol.<br>- Yes.

310
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,750
Does this mean I'm going see that jerk's face often?

311
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,330
The work isn't too hard?

312
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,460
- No. <br> - Did you miss me?

313
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,450
I didn't hear from you. I missed you.

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,250
- You did, Sunbae? <br> - Yes.

315
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,260
- Why? <br> - No, I...

316
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:09,050
The last message you sent

317
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:14,070
made it seem like you meant for us to not meet at all during the break.

318
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,180
That was just a text to wish you a good break.

319
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:22,140
<i>Ah, why am I like this?!</i>

320
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,320
<i>I feel so bad.</i>

321
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,540
I didn't know that you would think like that. I'm sorry.

322
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:33,000
I-It's fine. I'm sorry, I didn't know that it meant that.

323
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,410
To be honest, I...

324
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,290
It's my first time dating...

325
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,220
Seol, when you have time this weekend,

326
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,330
should we go on a date?

327
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,180
A date?

328
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,530
<i>Hey you! You should try going around wearing something fancy.</i>

329
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:09,860
Something fancy?

330
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,330
<i>Because your face is dull.</i>

331
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,970
I only have dull clothing.

332
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:19,230
That's right, this.

333
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,320
That's good.

334
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,380
<i>Hey, Dog fur!</i>

335
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,570
<i>Dog fur!</i>

336
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,920
I'm going to straighten it.

337
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,730
Of course, this is how Baek In Ha spends.

338
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,210
Otherwise, it wouldn't be like her.

339
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,040
Yes, Father, it's me.

340
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,130
I have something to tell you.

341
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:19,330
The academy called saying that

342
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,480
In Ha asked for a refund of the tuition fee.

343
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,570
I think some financial pressure is necessary.

344
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,570
Without financial support In Ha too will get her head on straight.

345
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,870
Yes, Father.

346
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,920
I'll see you in front of the office at 2 pm.

347
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:11,680
Dog Fur! Where are you going? It's the weekend. When are you treating me?

348
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,040
- I don't have time.<br>- So when are you going to treat me?

349
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,570
Do you not have anything else to do? You're always wandering about in the neighborhood.

350
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:21,760
Wande— I just came from trying to get a part-time job.

351
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,270
Wandering around?

352
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,920
You went to an interview dressed like that?

353
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,310
- What's wrong with this?<br>- It looks too worn out.

354
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,850
- Worn?<br>- I mean...

355
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,740
When you go to an interview, it's crucial for you to leave a good impression.

356
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,660
Don't wear a t-shirt, but a shirt with a collar. A long-sleeved one.

357
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,970
And even if you unbutton it, maybe just one.

358
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,360
Your pants should also not have rips and holes in them. Try wearing something black or navy.

359
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,670
Also, going bare feet is the same as suicide.

360
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:51,020
I haven't heard anyone getting a job after going to an interview barefoot.

361
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,810
Then what about you?

362
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,080
Who are you to say anything to me after wearing strange clothes?

363
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:58,590
- What? Me?<br>- Are you going to a senior gathering or something?

364
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,340
Your're wearing grandma-like clothes.

365
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:02,560
I wore the fanciest clothes I owned.

366
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,710
Fancy? Did you really wear this because I told you to dress fancier?

367
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,790
Wow, I didn't know I had such an impression on you.

368
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,510
But this isn't fancy, it's granny.

369
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:18,120
You aren't going to meet a guy dressed like this, right?

370
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,700
You're probably not. You're not, right?

371
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,600
If you wear this to meet a guy... This doesn't make sense.

372
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,770
You're probably not. Really.

373
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,090
- Yah, Dog— Yah!

374
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:35,060
You really look like a grandmother from the back!

375
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,740
Am I a bit late?

376
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:09,100
No, I just got here too.

377
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,050
- You're pretty.<br>- I didn't really do anything.

378
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,120
Oh, you bought the tickets already.

379
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,380
Do you want popcorn? I'll buy it.

380
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,450
I have a coupon.

381
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,810
It's a 4,000 won discount.

382
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:33,520
Do you want cheese or onion? Which flavor...

383
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,610
<i>Why is he like this?</i>

384
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,120
- <i>Does he not know what a coupon is?</i><br>- Uh...

385
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,360
We still have some time left.

386
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,780
Do you want to go to a cafe?

387
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,480
But we don't have a lot of time, it's just going to be a waste of money.

388
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,030
So how this works is...

389
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,670
You shoot when you step on it and you hide when you step off.

390
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,220
Understand? Also, when you want to reload, just shake it like this.

391
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,670
When you want to change your gun, press it 1, 2, 3, 4 times.

392
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,860
Anyway, this time it's for real... Try it, it's really fun.

393
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,940
Now! There.

394
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Awesome! That's amazing!

395
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,510
Awesome! Awesome! You made a new record!

396
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,990
Sunbae, is this really the first time you've done this?

397
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,230
- Do you want to give it a try?<br><i>- This isn't me, this isn't me.</i> I'll try, I'll try.

398
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:27,660
- Oh...<br>- <i>This is so awkward.</i>

399
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,660
What? You were the one to buy me stuff just because you liked me. Hey!

400
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,820
What do you mean cough it up? It's the cost for catering to and playing with you.

401
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,260
- Customer...<br>- Don't contact me ever again.

402
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:43,520
I'll call the police if you try calling me again, you jerk.

403
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,450
- What?<br>- I'm sorry, but this card has been suspended.

404
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,960
What? This is so annoying.

405
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,020
This one also doesn't work, customer.

406
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,450
Are you sure you swiped it correctly?

407
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:07,260
It worked well yesterday, why would it suddenly...?

408
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,060
He did this to me?

409
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:19,170
Ahjusshi, what am I going to do if you suddenly stop my card?

410
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:22,750
How is a woman living alone supposed to live without money?

411
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:26,560
In Ha, I told you I'd give you a job once you pass your certification.

412
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,790
<i>These days it's hard for young people to get job opportunities. Why aren't you trying when given the chance?</i>

413
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:35,270
It's too hard to pass the certification.

414
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:37,660
You know that I'm not that smart.

415
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,520
Don't blame your head. You have to try.

416
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,180
<i>You're an adult now, too.</i>

417
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:46,030
<i>You should try getting a proper job.</i>

418
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:50,750
But I have to have tuition fees to go to classes. You're going to give me tuition fees, aren't you?

419
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,240
Just for the first month.

420
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,940
I've told the school, so you can't get it refunded.

421
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,960
<i>And I'm going to check to see if you're going.</i>

422
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,360
Jeong even said that you need to study.

423
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,350
He insisted to me that you need to have a career.

424
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,170
Jeong, too?

425
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:09,870
Because many people are concerned about you like that,

426
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,890
get ready to find a job.

427
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,470
I have great expectations from you.

428
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,590
Yoo Jeong that fox-like jerk!

429
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,390
But why is he making a big deal of cutting me off? Why?

430
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,170
What did I do? I was just quietly shopping!

431
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,110
Oh why, WHY?!

432
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,080
<i>Baek In Ha</i>

433
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:44,150
<i>Make me something I can use for reading.</i>

434
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,150
<i>Even our tastes in movies don't match.</i>

435
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,590
<i>I like action movies better than this.</i>

436
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,620
Is it not interesting?

437
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,410
You're not going to eat any?

438
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:03,130
Yeah -- don't mind me, just eat.

439
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,250
<i>Baek In Ha</i>

440
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,120
Go ahead and answer it.

441
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,200
No, I don't have to answer it.

442
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,390
<i>Is there gold dust sprinkled on the food here?</i>

443
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,210
<i>Why is it so expensive?</i>

444
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:38,220
Excuse me... Sunbae, we don't have to eat here.

445
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,520
The atmosphere is too stiff here, isn't it?

446
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,800
The food here is good, though.

447
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,330
<i>Something cheap... The cheapest one...</i>

448
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,830
<i>Oh, this. This, this.</i>

449
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,970
Did you decide?

450
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,450
Yes.

451
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,220
<i>The fact that this is over 10,000 won...</i>

452
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,550
<i>Sunbae must be accustomed to places like this.</i>

453
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,310
Are you really going to be fine with just that? Try some of this.

454
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,840
Ah no, it's okay.

455
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,430
Don't you eat meat?

456
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,630
I ate too much popcorn before.

457
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,040
Then you must feel like you had too much greasy food. Let's have a glass of wine.

458
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,270
Huh?

459
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,660
No, it's really okay.

460
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,450
- I'll go with this one. <br> - Yes.

461
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:41,970
<i>Even a 15,000 Won soup feels excessive to me,</i>

462
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:46,210
<i>yet Sunbae orders wine as if it's nothing.</i>

463
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:51,200
<i>I want to go home.</i>

464
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,230
You have a good physique and you look strong.

465
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:00,390
Come to work tomorrow.

466
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:02,870
Yes!

467
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,550
- Soo Hwi,<br>- Oh, Director.

468
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:06,700
Who's that?

469
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,040
I hired our new janitor.

470
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,650
Hello, I'm Baek In Ho.

471
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:15,180
It's too much of a waste to use him as a janitor.

472
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,530
They only took a couple of photos of me. Why did they give me so much money?

473
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,650
Do they have a lot of money?

474
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,410
To think that Dog Fur can be useful at times.

475
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:33,260
I guess clothes do give you wings?

476
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:38,150
- Hello. <br> - <i>Hey, do you have money?</i>

477
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,940
How did you know?

478
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,470
What's with him? Where did he pick up clothes that don't even suit him?

479
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,160
Oh, how disgusting! What is this?

480
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,980
- But you hate dressing up? Did you go on an arranged date?<br>- What? What do you want?

481
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,120
Where's the money? Did you bring it?

482
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,480
Do you want to be punched by me?

483
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,670
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to? That jerk, Yoo Jeong,

484
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,050
convinced Ahjusshi to suspend all of my cards.

485
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:09,260
I thought it was weird when he told me to get a certificate and find a job.

486
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,390
He knew that I wouldn't do it.

487
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,600
He's acting so cheap just because I wouldn't listen to him.

488
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,620
I don't even have money to live off of right now. What if I starve and die because they suspended my cards?

489
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,960
What have you been doing that you don't have any money, you bum?

490
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,370
I don't even have money to go back home with. Hurry and give me money.

491
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,650
Well...

492
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,350
This will really be the last time.

493
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,100
Please just wake up. Until when do you think that family is going to take care of you?

494
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,520
Don't you know already that Yoo Jeong's trying to cut us out of his life after he suspended your cards?

495
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,380
It's not <i>us.</i> It's probably just you.

496
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,010
If you'd get rid of that "don't give a crap" attitude and walk with only your head down, it would be all over.

497
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,600
I told you to stop talking about that.

498
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,730
If you don't like it, you can just go hide and disappear again.

499
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:06,950
I abandoned you once. You don't think I can do it again?

500
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,870
Yah! You...

501
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,400
Oh, seriously!

502
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,180
Teacher Assistant Heo seems like he's making it hard on you.

503
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,360
Ah, well, you know his personality is irritable to begin with.

504
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,860
It's not like I didn't know.

505
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,490
I wanted to study English with my free time, but there was just too much for me to do.

506
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:40,610
Study English?

507
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:46,840
Yeah, I went to employment counseling and they told me that I was lacking in speaking English.

508
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,790
Ah, that... I know someone who opened an academy. Should I introduce you guys?

509
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,370
He'll give you a discount if I tell him you're my friend.

510
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,990
Ah no, it's alright.

511
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:59,170
It will be hard to find time to study during the semester. Wouldn't it be better to do it during the break?

512
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:02,130
True. That's right. But this time...

513
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,530
Is it here?

514
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,210
Yes, that's right, over there.

515
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:26,090
Now what? Don't tell me... No don't, don't...

516
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,050
Thank you for today. Drive home safely.

517
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,350
Yes.

518
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,220
I'll watch you go. Hurry and go.

519
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,430
Yes.

520
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,740
Ah, that was hard.

521
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,320
Are all dates this tiring?

522
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,330
Ah... So uncomfortable...

523
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,980
Ah, I'm so hungry.

524
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,420
I will have rice.

525
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,450
Let's see.

526
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:12,130
<i>Your call cannot be connected. At the beep...</i>

527
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,470
Is he not going to pick up for the entire day?

528
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:17,800
Sure. Let's see who's going to win until the end.

529
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,260
I'm going to call until you pick up.

530
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,570
Yah, where are you right now? Let's meet.

531
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,430
Why would I?

532
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:40,520
<i>Did you suspend In Ha's card?</i>

533
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:43,140
You should have at least cut them off after she got a job.

534
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:47,160
I warned you, not to be around me.

535
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,650
<i>What?!</i>

536
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,490
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

537
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,480
That bast—

538
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,690
Welcome.

539
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:08,660
The reason he doesn't want me to hang around, is because of her?

540
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,750
But I don't want to listen. What are you going to do?

541
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,040
What kind of girl eats this kind of food

542
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,640
like a wrestler at this time?

543
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,070
You didn't buy kimchi, right?

544
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,620
I want to buy it, but I'm missing 500 won.

545
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:46,270
Ramen without kimchi is like steamed buns without the filling. Or wraps without the meat.

546
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:50,330
And chicken without the pickled radishes. What else is there?

547
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,900
Now I can live.

548
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,400
I will eat well.

549
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,110
Don't eat it. It's mine.

550
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,410
I bought it.

551
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,710
You bought it for me. If so, what kind of ownership is this for me?

552
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,690
Let's split it in half.

553
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:12,890
Let's split it in half evenly.

554
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,360
You have too much.

555
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,620
Wait.

556
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,420
You look better dressed like that.

557
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,390
You look much better than earlier, too.

558
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,360
- Did you get the part-time job?<br>- Thanks to you.

559
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,040
Are you ambidextrous? That's unique.

560
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,930
Who?

561
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:54,140
I was originally left-handed, but I became this way after an accident.

562
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,300
Yoo Jeong did this to my hand.

563
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,430
Sunbae,

564
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:17,330
did that to your hand?

565
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,060
I suppose you can't tell by looking at him.

566
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,770
You be careful, too.

567
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,180
Later if you get stabbed in the back and cry, I won't help you.

568
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,900
Yes, Father.

569
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:44,750
- Did you get a call from In Ha? <br> - Yes.

570
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,830
Yes. Even so don't push so hard.

571
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,720
If you don't loosen up on the reins, and

572
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,580
keep on pulling hard, it's an easy way to fall off the horse.

573
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,240
Yes. Don't be too concerned about In Ha.

574
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,410
I will take care of it.

575
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,520
Okay, I know.

576
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:08,120
Don't think you're getting off because you bought some kimchi.

577
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,840
Buy me a meal.

578
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,850
I, too,

579
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,640
can barely survive working so hard.

580
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:22,970
Hey, at least you work in air-conditioning. How hard can that be?

581
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:25,980
It would be better if it were physical labor.

582
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,660
I get abused whether I try hard or not.

583
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,660
I get blamed if I make mistakes or not.

584
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:35,240
Whether I make coffee or not,

585
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,830
I get cursed at.

586
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,570
So, do you just take all that?

587
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,550
Of course, that's why your life is so suffocating.

588
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,830
You're always saying, "No, it's fine. Yes, I understand," or

589
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,990
"I'll try my best," right?

590
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,660
If you continue living your life like that,

591
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,410
you are going to live on the short end.

592
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,840
I don't know

593
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,090
about the world.

594
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,970
If you just live like a fool, you're going to be on the short end.

595
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:11,110
Look, you just let me insult you.

596
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,050
If you're thankful, then buy me a meal.

597
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,500
What shall we do next? Do you want to cooly gnaw on some Korean beef for once?

598
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:19,580
This jerk and meat...

599
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,690
Excuse me! My biggest stress is being indebted to you!

600
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:26,480
Did you leave your money with me?

601
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,410
You really have gone too far.

602
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,670
That's right. That's how you should talk back.

603
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,430
I'm going.

604
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,340
He looks like a scam artist.

605
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,870
Aigoo, I'm so full. I think I can live now.

606
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,210
He doesn't seem like a bad person.

607
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,380
What happened between Sunbae and him?

608
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,610
Can he hear me?

609
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:26,010
<i> I've talked to the academy, so make sure to go. </i>

610
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:30,510
His pushiness is phenomenal.

611
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:37,920
Is it okay for me to keep accepting?

612
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:46,240
<i>Thank you. About today...</i>

613
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,430
<i> It was fun. </i>

614
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,140
<i>Sorry, I feel like I'm always mooching off of you.</i>

615
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:58,040
<i> Next time, I'll buy you a meal. </i>

616
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,880
Okay, sleep well.

617
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:11,110
<i>You too, sleep well.</i>

618
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:18,130
This is what I'm supposed to do, right?

619
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,470
It's awkward.

620
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:30,160
For free? Not even a discount, but for free?

621
00:45:30,190 --> 00:45:34,450
Yes, the director left special instructions.

622
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:38,440
I understand.

623
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,250
- Are you registering or not? <br> - I'll come back.

624
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,800
It looks like him.

625
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:09,170
Hey, Dog Fur! What are you doing here? You go to school here?

626
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,370
Yes, why...

627
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:14,050
I told you about my job, I work here.

628
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:17,420
I am an advertising model and a teacher's assistant in the children's class.

629
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,100
And I do some miscellaneous jobs.

630
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,180
But why do we keep getting so entwined?

631
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,850
Let's eat together from now on.

632
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,040
We can have snacks and drinks together then.

633
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,430
Hey, I'm glad I got this job.

634
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:30,290
Congratulations on getting hired.

635
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:33,710
- Do your work. <br> - Okay, go.

636
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:36,440
We'll see each other every day now.

637
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:40,650
Why is it that academy out of all of them?

638
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,750
Did he do it on purpose?

639
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:46,080
- Thanks, honey. There's nothing you can't do.<br>- It was nothing.

640
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,260
- Oh, honey, you came? <br> - Hello. <br> - This is

641
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,820
- the landlady's grandson. Greet him. <br> - Hello. <br> - Hello.

642
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,880
Oh, that's right. Are your windows okay?

643
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,500
I said our window which was rattling too much should be fixed and he just came to fix it.

644
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,360
- Oh, really? I bet your skills are really good. <br> - Oh, no they're not.

645
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,010
Tell him to change your window.

646
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:09,840
It's quite bothersome.

647
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,180
Yes, then I guess I can take a look at it.

648
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,110
The neighborhood's been noisy about the local thief.

649
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,770
It's good to take precautions beforehand.

650
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:21,290
- And you're a woman... <br> - That's great!

651
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:24,450
- Thank you, then...<br> - Go on in.

652
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:28,810
But do you advertise? Don't you advertise?

653
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,110
- Yes, it's over here. <br> - Okay.

654
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:39,630
Wow, this is serious.

655
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,320
Oh, this looks like it will come off with just a little pressure.

656
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,870
Should I lift the mattress?

657
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,120
- Oh, yes. <br> - Help me with it. Wait a second.

658
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,500
I don't know if I can fix it perfectly.

659
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:54,210
- I'm not a repairman. <br> - It's okay.

660
00:47:54,230 --> 00:47:57,990
I'm thankful that you're taking a look at it.

661
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,800
I don't think I have all the tools, but I'll give it a try.

662
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,400
I'll move out of this room.

663
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,450
Can I leave before the lease is over?

664
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:15,960
I don't know that well,

665
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,620
but I'll ask my grandmother.

666
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,510
Yes. Yes, Sunbae.

667
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:29,270
<i>Hello?</i>

668
00:48:29,270 --> 00:48:32,420
I went to the academy today,

669
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,810
and they told me that it was for free.

670
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,590
I didn't know. He must have done that because you're my friend.

671
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:43,640
Yes. But to not pay at all is a bit...

672
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,330
you know.

673
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,770
<i> Just attend happily. </i>

674
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:51,490
- Are you home? <br> - The landlady's grandson

675
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:54,100
is checking the window.

676
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,490
- Teacher Cho.<i> - Yes?</i>

677
00:48:56,490 --> 00:48:58,600
Can't you fix your pronunciation?

678
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:00,890
It's difficult because it's my native tongue.

679
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,520
My goodness, since you speak English with that accent,

680
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:08,120
Ah Jeong, what brings you here? One moment please.

681
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,660
I'll see you later.

682
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:14,810
This is for the favor I asked, and just this and that.

683
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:18,310
It wasn't anything much, you didn't have to do this.

684
00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,390
What is your relationship with that girl that you asked me for a favor?

685
00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:25,840
What is it? Is she your girlfriend?

686
00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:28,720
I haven't told my father yet, so please keep it a secret.

687
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,890
Wow, then I got introduced to her before the chairman.

688
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:34,110
It's an honor.

689
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,420
Oh, is the chairman doing well?

690
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,060
- Yes. <br> - Is that someone you know?

691
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:45,000
Yes.

692
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:51,530
Here. Finish this by today, it's urgent.

693
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,420
<i>He's starting again.</i>

694
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,210
Yes, is that for today?

695
00:49:56,210 --> 00:49:58,210
It's too much work to get done.

696
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:02,590
All you have to punch in X's. Why can't you do that?

697
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:08,310
<i>If you keep living that way, people will always take advantage of you.</i>

698
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:16,290
Senior Heo, I apologize but it's too much to get done in one day.

699
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:20,300
Even if it weren't me, it would be too much for anyone to do.

700
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:26,250
Did you eat something wrong today? I said it was urgent. Just do what I tell you to do!

701
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:32,410
You're talking about the thing that is supposed to be done by next week, aren't you?

702
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:37,430
Technically speaking it is. But it's better if it's done sooner.

703
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,880
I'll try to do it as quickly as I can

704
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,340
although it might not be done by today.

705
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,150
What?

706
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,590
Seol.

707
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:53,120
Jeong! Thanks.

708
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:58,140
Jeong, hurry up and take Seol out. Buy her something good to eat.

709
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,900
Go.

710
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:00,480
Let's go.

711
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,180
I'll be right back.

712
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,000
Thank you for the class.

713
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,410
Oh, is it worth going to? And there's nothing else going on?

714
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:20,620
<i>It's probably better not to bring up Baek In Ho, right?</i>

715
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,680
<i>It doesn't seem like they get along. It will only ruin his mood.</i>

716
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,610
No, there's nothing much going on.

717
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:30,540
Really? That's a relief.

718
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:32,830
But what brings you here in the morning?

719
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:36,730
I just wanted to see your face before going to class.

720
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:39,300
Why? You don't like it?

721
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,900
No.

722
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:46,150
I better get going. I'll call you after class.

723
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,820
Okay.

724
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:52,250
<i>There's nothing going on.</i>

725
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,240
Your grades are also good so is that why you are going as an exchange student for language training?

726
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,540
I'm just getting worn out.

727
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,290
How long will you be gone?

728
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,090
It might take another year.

729
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:07,990
A year? Ah, you were close with Jeong, weren't you?

730
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:11,050
Jeong was briefly here at school earlier, too.

731
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:12,810
Why was Yoo Jeong here during the break?

732
00:52:12,810 --> 00:52:15,100
Why? Seol and Jeong...

733
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,140
Assistant Kim!

734
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,710
Oh.

735
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,630
I wasn't supposed to say, was I? Sorry.

736
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,320
Come and talk with me.

737
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,930
I'm in the middle of working hours.

738
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:32,090
It will only take a moment. Come talk to me.

739
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:39,640
What do you have to say?

740
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,910
You tried so hard to deceive me that you weren't, but in the end, you're dating.

741
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:47,120
We really weren't dating back then.

742
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:52,070
In any case, it just turned out like this, so I hope you're not too disappointed.

743
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:57,210
I'm not in a position to get mad either.

744
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,380
What?

745
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,220
I have something to say.

746
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:07,870
Actually, as you know, I didn't like you very much.

747
00:53:07,870 --> 00:53:12,900
I was already annoyed that I lost my top spot to you, but one day Sunbae started talking about you and taking care of you.

748
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:18,080
And after the fight over your report, he started acting cold to me.

749
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:23,320
That's why I sent that homeless man to you.

750
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:27,790
<i>Do you see the light on over on the second floor?</i>

751
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:30,400
<i>Over there?</i>

752
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:36,060
<i>If you go there, there is a girl waiting for you who will listen to you.</i>

753
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:41,490
Do you know what you're saying right now?

754
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:45,050
I didn't intend for you to get hurt.

755
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:50,360
And I went to Yoo Jeong to help because I became worried about you.

756
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:57,140
I even told him that you might be in danger, but he just left.

757
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:05,540
What is it that you want to say?

758
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,010
So Sunbae Yoo Jeong...

759
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:11,840
What's important about Sunbae Yoo Jeong helping or not helping?

760
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:15,170
What's important is that you did that to me.

761
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,160
Don't you see the scar? What if it had been my face?

762
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,580
That's why I'm apologizing like this, that it was hard for me.

763
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,890
If it was so hard for you, how did you keep it in?

764
00:54:26,890 --> 00:54:30,880
You're apologizing after coincidentally running into me?

765
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,750
You want to be on top, and get the guy, and it would be nice if the kid you didn't like got knocked down a little.

766
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:41,410
And you want to apologize to ease your conscience. And you want to pass the blame onto someone else.

767
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:46,320
Why do you only do whatever you want all the way to the end?

768
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:49,430
Okay, I understand. I'm really sorry.

769
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:55,630
You are really not sorry.

770
00:54:58,710 --> 00:55:02,410
Go. I don't have anything further to say to you.

771
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:12,580
Joo Yeon, don't ever show up in front of me again.

772
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,530
They're both really vicious.

773
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,300
<i>Hold up your arm.</i>

774
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,960
My goodness, why are there so many homeless people these days?

775
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,760
<i>I'm late.</i>

776
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:43,660
<i>Sunbae, what brings you here?</i>

777
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:45,860
<i>I called the guards.</i>

778
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,220
<i>You should have stopped where the line was drawn.</i>

779
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,090
<i>I came because I was really worried about Seol.</i>

780
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:59,260
<i>I didn't know it would get this far. Can't you overlook it this once?</i>

781
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,430
<i>This really won't do.</i>

782
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:09,290
<i>I'll do as you ask. But this is as far as it goes.</i>

783
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:26,960
<i>Don't ever come into my sight again.</i>

784
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:39,900
<i>I'm not going to tell you that Sunbae helped you, Hong Seol.</i>

785
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:45,030
<i>And the fact that he isn't the warm person you think he is.</i>

786
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,260
Total.

787
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,230
Everybody, total.

788
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:55,050
<i>If what Joo Yeon said was true,</i>

789
00:56:55,050 --> 00:57:01,580
<i>why in the world did he ask to date me.</i>

790
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,190
<i>What is he thinking?</i>

791
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,350
<i>Fourteen.</i>

792
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,740
<i>Courage to move forward.</i>

793
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,390
Dog fur!

794
00:57:19,390 --> 00:57:21,460
Hello.

795
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:23,780
What's wrong? Something happened?

796
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:27,480
No, I will leave first.

797
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,550
Where do you think you're going? Come here.

798
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:30,690
Why are you being like this?

799
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,080
- Come here.<br>- Why are you doing this?

800
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:46,170
Now, you fold the tests like this. And you pass them out to the children to solve.

801
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:51,360
Now, student Bob. Catch this.

802
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:54,790
Good job, good luck on the test. Good job!

803
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:58,060
But can you really fold test papers like this?

804
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:03,430
Of course. They're kids. Kids. Kids like it better when you do this.

805
00:58:03,430 --> 00:58:09,210
Now, student Charles. See, he likes it. Charles, catch this. Do your best!

806
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:13,800
But the plane doesn't fly well.

807
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:14,740
It flew.

808
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,290
You can't fold it like that. For a plane, see, I'll show you.

809
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:21,030
What other student is there?

810
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,680
There's a lot. There's Jack, too.

811
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,400
Jack. Student Jack, good luck on your test.

812
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,800
Did you see that? This is a plane. Now, student Jack.

813
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,560
Isn't that better?

814
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:44,610
You laughed.

815
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,760
I don't have an umbrella though.

816
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:01,690
The one who loses going (running) to the store has to buy the umbrella.

817
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:04,680
Then I'm at a disadvantage.

818
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,740
- One.<br>- I said I wasn't going to do it.

819
00:59:06,740 --> 00:59:07,370
Three!

820
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:10,220
I said I wasn't going to do it!

821
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:57,620
I made some money.

822
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,820
What kind of girl cheats whenever it comes to money?

823
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:07,210
What? What kind of man whines about it to the end? You even shoved me in order to win.

824
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:09,620
Forget it. Never mind.

825
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,800
Your oppa can buy at least this much.

826
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:21,810
But, why did you look so down at English class? Did something happen?

827
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:22,660
No.

828
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:28,560
You're lying. I could tell just by looking at you. There is, isn't there?

829
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,690
It stopped raining.

830
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,830
You're right.

831
01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:44,470
What you said last time,

832
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:50,330
about your hand. Did Sunbae really do that?

833
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,530
Why? After spending time with him, are you starting to believe me?

834
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,590
Is what you said the truth?

835
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,140
Something happened with him, didn't it?

836
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:03,830
No.

837
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:09,160
Stop saying, no, no, and just say it. You'll get old that way.

838
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:14,430
Quit that. You always turn everything into a joke.

839
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,910
I'm not joking. It's because you really look old.

840
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,150
Look in the mirror. You'll be completely aged by then.

841
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:22,020
Sunbae.

842
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:31,030
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ viki. com </i>

843
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:33,770
You said there were burglars in the neighborhood.

844
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:38,410
Just in case, I checked your door and windows.

845
01:01:38,410 --> 01:01:39,820
Okay.

846
