<i>Cheese in the Trap</i>

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,560
Wow, she's totally getting her beauty sleep.

00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,500
Hey Hong! Hey Hong!

5
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,690
Wake up huh? Open your eyes!

6
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,860
She's gone, she's gone.

7
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,700
Oh, you smell like alcohol.

8
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:11,950
- Hey!<br><i> - I'm dead tired.</i>

9
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:17,430
<i>So tired. I said I'm so tired!</i>

10
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,180
<i>It's all because of you!</i>

11
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Ah, really. Drink this and come to your senses.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,370
Huh? Hey.

13
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:31,200
Hey! You need to stop drinking! We have to go to our second round. Come to your senses.

14
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,030
I'm going to take a leave of absence from school.

15
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,820
I'll also taking leave from school.

16
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,430
- What "leave of absence"? <br> - I'm taking off from school.

17
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,550
You're saying useless things. Hey, this won't do.

18
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,730
What's wrong with her?

19
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,290
She's being a serious pain right now.

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,500
I guess this won't do. Let's just go home, Hong.

21
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,190
I'm not going. I'm not going!

22
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:55,300
I'm taking a leave of absence. I'm really going to do it.

23
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,480
I'll do it too.

24
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,780
- I'm taking a leave...<br>- What's with you today?

25
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,060
You can't, no, no. Get your things please. Let's go home!

26
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,790
- Get up.<br> - Get up. Come on, get up.

27
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,140
Get up, get up.

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,760
Hey! Where did he go? Where did he go? Where?

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,170
Where did he go?

30
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,950
Hey! Hey!

31
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,520
Hey! There's blood.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,950
Oh you really...

33
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,760
There! Here he is! It's because of you.

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,090
Yeah.

35
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,120
<i>I'll disappear from your sight then.</i>

36
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,110
<i>Happy now?</i>

37
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,250
<i>Episode 1 </i>

38
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:04,600
<i>The reason why I decided to take a leave from school is...</i>

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,570
<i>1 year ago: Start of Semester Party</i>

40
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,030
Hello.

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,700
- Oh! Hong Seol!<br> - Hello.

42
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,060
- Hi, hi!<br>- Hong Seol.

43
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,970
Oh Congrats on coming back to school, Hong Seol!

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,840
After working part-time for a year, it feels great to be back in school, doesn't it?

45
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,780
Now that I see you, I'm happy.

46
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,670
Have a drink.

47
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:29,090
So this is Eun Taek?<br> - Yeah. No need to learn his name, he's just "Servant".

48
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,680
- How nice. You have a servant now. <br>- My servant is your servant.

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,890
- Right, Servant?<br>- Servant, cheers!

50
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,400
I don't think I deserve to hear this kind of talk.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,670
The cabbage is all set.

52
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,080
I'll add meat and ssam sauce in heaps and heaps.<br><i>(Ssam - sauce of red chili paste and soybean paste)</i>

53
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,680
I'll add some garlic.

54
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,580
Don't even make eye contact with that guy.

55
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:52,140
And nicely pour this!

56
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,830
Ha Jae Woo?

57
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,880
- I'm not eating it.<br> - Why? It's not dirty. Open wide.

58
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,570
- Ah, seriously! I'm how times do I have to tell you I'm not eating it!<br>-What's up with that guy.

59
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,080
I don't make this soju wrap for just anyone!

60
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,360
Look away, look away.

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,030
Seol! Our hoobae, Hong, just came back to schoo. To celebrate

62
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,950
why don't we enliven the party atmosphere?

63
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,720
What do you mean, enliven?

64
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,510
Ah, Sunbae, who eats things like that nowadays? Why are you being this way?

65
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,670
- Get up.<br>- Ah Sunbae that's too boring. Why don't you stop?

66
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,700
- It's the trick for those who can't hold their alcohol.<br> - Hurry, why don't you hold it?

67
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,520
Hurry. It's spilling. Hurry, hurry.<br>-Yeah why don't just eat it for him just once

68
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
Yeah, try it.

69
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,340
Here, here. Hong Hoobae! Hong Hoobae!

70
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,460
- ♫ How long are you going to have me sing and dance here <br><i> - Why don't you stop now huh?</i>

71
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,730
<i>I really hate these kind of things.</i><br>♫ Alcohol's going in!

72
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,480
♫ Straight down, down, down! Eat it, eat it, eat it!

73
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,470
Hurray!

74
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,260
Hey, Hong Seol. Congrats on being back ok?

75
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,480
Oh, Jeong, you came?

76
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,150
- Sunbae! Sunbae! Come, come have a seat here<br> - Oh Jeong, go there, there.

77
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,730
Sit across from me.

78
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,220
Hey you move! Move!

79
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,280
Ack! What is this? Give me this.

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,690
Everyone attention here for a second! Discharged from the military

81
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,200
and back for his junior year, is Yoo Jeong. Applause! Applause! Applause! Applause Applause Applause!

82
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,460
Haven't you also heard a lot about Sunbae Yoo Jeong?

83
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,390
He still has his killer visual even after so long.

84
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,970
But, his appearance is a bit cold.

85
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:22,190
Hey what do you mean cold? He's the epitome of perfect. Isn't that right, Servant?

86
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,120
Yes, I guess so.

87
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,590
But, he's sooo perfect, that he's not my type.

88
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,430
Speaking of which, a man should have some imperfections to have charm.

89
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,880
This imperfect man will give you some meat. Here you go.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,080
Just watch. Now Da-Yeong Unni and Nam Joo Yeon are going to put on a show, trying to look good for him.

91
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,410
Sunbae, I'll make a wrap for you.

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,330
- Sunbae...<br> - Sure, thanks.

93
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,360
Watch this. Nam Joo Yeon is on her way.

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,740
What? You guys have met before?

95
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,530
We met after starting college. But then you went off to military service.

96
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,800
Ah, really? What's your name?

97
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,910
I'm Nam Joo Yeon. Take good care of me.

98
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,940
Take good care of me too.

99
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,620
The table is a bit messy. Shall we order some more food?

100
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,700
- No, it's okay. I ate before coming.<br> - No, we should order something for you.

101
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,220
But I'm okay...<br> - Cockle? Buchimgae (Korean fried pancake)? What do you like?

102
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,200
Jeong doesn't eat things like that. All your tastes are so cheap.

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,740
Oh there it is. Sea-son-ed Sk-ate.

104
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,470
Order something else. That's expensive!

105
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,070
Hey, Jeong is the Seasoned Skate Killer.

106
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,550
He's the one who wants to eat it, but he's calling Sunbae Yoo Jeong the Seasoned Skate Killer.

107
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:29,830
Sunbae, I'll pour you a drink.

108
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:32,120
- No, it's okay, I'll do it.<br> - No, I'll pour it.

109
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,890
- It's okay, I'll do it.<br> - No, Ill pour it.

110
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,920
- It's okay.<br>- No, I'll...

111
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,320
- Are you okay?<br> - Hey, get some tissues!

112
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,840
Are you okay? Hey, go on and clean your clothes.

113
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,950
<i>It looked like he spilled it on purpose.</i>

114
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,380
Clean it.

115
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,230
<i>He's smiling.</i>

116
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,660
<i>He really did spill it on purpose.</i>

117
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,420
Where are you going?

118
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:06,650
<i>You told me to clean it.</i>

119
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,500
What's with that sunbae?

120
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,550
I've got a bad taste in my mouth.

121
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:29,060
O-O-Oh, Seol, you were over there?

122
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,390
Yes. What are you doing, Sunbae?

123
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,040
I was calculating the fees we collected for our outing.

124
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:39,020
Do they really have to always make old me count their money, right Seol? Aigoo.

125
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,240
Hyung, we should go for a second round. We've got money left over, right?

126
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,320
- What do you mean, left over? It's all gone! We need to collect 20,000₩ ($17.29) from everyone.<br>- What?

127
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:51,230
- What do you mean? Who would pay 20 000₩ to go?<br>- We have Jeong. Why are you worried?

128
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:56,990
- It's Jeong's first day back!<br>- His family is rich, and Jeong's quite generous.

129
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,920
Hoobae Hong! You're going for the second round, aren't you?

130
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,230
No, not me.

131
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,190
Ah, why? I'll buy you something delicious! Seriously, man.

132
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,560
Then, are you paying?

133
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,430
Why would I pay? Yoo Jeong is here.

134
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,410
- Stop leeching off him.<br>- Hey, since we haven't seen him in awhile, he's going to pay for everything.

135
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:13,890
<i>That time...</i>

136
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,120
<i>I shouldn't have run into him like that</i>

137
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,860
<i>That was the beginning.</i>

138
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,660
Hey, Hong Seol! Hong Seol!

139
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,960
You did it, didn't you? You said that I stole from the club funds for the Start of Semester Party?

140
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,710
You're the one who put it on the message board!

141
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,210
Wait, what do you mean?

142
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,060
Look. Are you still going to say that it wasn't you?<br><i>Amounts on receipts don't match the fees. Where's the money? Investigation needed.</i>

143
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,520
Wow, you're quite the actress.

144
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,240
You're so good at playing dumb.

145
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,000
I got dragged to the Disciplinary Board because of this.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,500
They accused me of messing with funds from last year, interrogated me, and—

147
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,300
No, I didn't do it.

148
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,300
- What do you mean you didn't? You be quiet!<br> - Do you have proof?

149
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,830
You're the only one who saw me counting the money on the stairs that day.

150
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,210
Why could it only be me? Someone else was there too.

151
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:06,690
Who? Who else was there? Who was there?

152
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,590
<i>It was that smile.</i>

153
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,910
There wasn't anyone there but you! Just you!

154
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,910
Ah, Sunbae, quiet down and let's talk things out.

155
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,910
- Hey how can you stab me in the back like that? <br> - Sunbae!

156
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,190
Whoever put that on the message board isn't the wrongdoer.

157
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:24,310
Talk with me later, okay?

158
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,940
Ah, seriously! I'll see you later.

159
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,640
Oh, that jinsang (unsightly thing). He's really taking it to the end, huh?

160
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,800
Seol, I think that you just did what you had to do.

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,810
I'll try talking to Sunbae Sang Cheol to help him understand.

162
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,640
There's no chance that

163
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,150
you're being honest?

164
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,460
I'm asking if you really think I did that.

165
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,820
You were there below the stairs too.

166
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,300
- What do you mean?<br> - You saw everything there.

167
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,700
It wasn't me.

168
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,370
Then, who would it be?

169
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,080
How dare you? Are you saying that Sunbae called out Sunbae Sang Cheol?

170
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,120
Do you know how hard he worked to deal with this?

171
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,340
The e-board members who threatened to report it to the police, he talked to every one of them, and even paid them back.

172
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,410
Joo Yeon, that's enough.

173
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:21,790
Hey, Hong Seol, so are you saying that he reported Sang Cheol behind his back and at the outset helped him, too?

174
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,300
- Are you writing a novel right now?<br>- It really wasn't you?

175
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,500
<i>I shouldn't have pushed it like that.</i>

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,090
<i>Behind that smile of Sunbae's</i>

177
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,830
<i>was a scary duality </i>

178
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:40,830
<i>that I didn't really know of, back then.</i>

179
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,760
Thank you.

180
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,930
Hel–

181
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:49,790
- Two Americanos please.<br> - Please wait one moment, please.

182
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,950
Hong Seol, did you even properly apologize to Sunbae?

183
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,550
You didn't even greet him properly back there.

184
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:05,130
Sunbae is letting it go because he has such a nice personality. If it were me, I wouldn't have been so nice.

185
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:08,070
- So what?<br> - You should know how to be grateful.

186
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,900
Hi, Seol.

187
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:16,400
<i>What is with this human?</i>

188
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Sunbae, you'll be late for class. Let's go quickly.

189
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,920
Wait a minute.

190
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:26,640
Seol, I noticed you drink a lot of coffee.

191
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,440
- Drink something that's good for you.<br>- What?

192
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,380
<i>He just ignored me back there. Why is he being like this now?</i>

193
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,210
See you later.

194
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:43,090
You're trying so hard for him to notice you.

195
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,190
Are you happy now?

196
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,660
<i>Did he just talk to me to purposely pretend to be friendly with me</i>

197
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,110
<i>for Nam Joo Yeon to watch?</i>

198
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,190
Why isn't she coming yet?

199
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,620
What are you doing this weekend?

200
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,130
<i>- Blinded by love, Nam Joo Yeon began to torment me.</i> <br> - Can you work on the assignment with me?

201
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,400
- I'll be working on it at home.

202
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,690
What? You were sleeping? What are you going to do about class?

203
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,290
- It's 10 AM, though.<br>- <i>Hey!</i> The class starts at 10 AM! Get it together!

204
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,960
<i>What about your attendance grade? We have a quiz!</i>

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,560
It's an auto F if you miss even once! Didn't you know that?

206
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,470
The grade representative told me that the start time changed to 1 PM!

207
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:42,010
What? Nam Joo Yeon did?

208
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:45,930
Hey. It's 3 hours of continuous lecture, so you better fly here right now.

209
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,860
Ah... What is she talking about

210
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,330
Hey, Nam Joo Yeon! Did you tell Hong that class was at one o'clock?

211
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:58,080
Ah, right, sorry. It looks like I made a mistake in communication.

212
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,870
How can a wench that calls herself grade rep., make Hong suffer this way?!

213
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,140
- This little... Really!<br> - Hold it in, Noona, you'll be the one who'll look weird if you do this.

214
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,840
What do I do? Even if she runs from home, it'll take her more than 20 minutes.

215
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,630
Why is the Professor not here yet? I should call him.

216
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,510
You wait in front of the classroom and kidnap the professor for just an hour.

217
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,030
Ah... what kind of nonsense are you saying/

218
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,060
I'll kiss you on the cheek.

219
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,830
- Hey.<br> - Who do you think I am?

220
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,370
Why is the door like this?

221
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,430
Teaching Assistant Heo?

222
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,710
Well, uhm... The professor suddenly had horrible stomach cramps,

223
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,710
and he went to the emergency room so he might not make it to the class.

224
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,280
Is she crazy? I'm taking attendance.

225
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:33,010
- Then, we'll do the quiz.<br> - How can you do that?!

226
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,590
- It's here, brat.<br> - We don't even have scheduled lecture today, so why take roll?

227
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,000
- The professor is not even here so why would there be a quiz?<br> - It was the professor's directions.

228
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,260
But who are you to be saying that?

229
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,030
Huh?! Who the heck are you?!

230
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,330
I'm sorry.

231
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,260
Noona... I'll be back. Just wait a bit.

232
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,630
Where? Hey. We're in the middle of the class. Are you going to the bathroom now?

233
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,320
Heo Kyeong Joo.

234
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,770
Assistant Professor, I'm so sorry. I didn't have bus fare,

235
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,110
so I walked here. I'm so sorry.

236
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,720
Go inside go.

237
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,440
Teaching Assistant, I love you!

238
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,400
Hey! What're you doing!

239
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,290
- Bring it here now.<br> - I'm sorry, but It's mine now!!!

240
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,340
Bring it here you punk. Bring it back!

241
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,760
Why would you take that!!

242
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,060
- Bring that back, bastard!<br>- It's mine!

243
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,570
Noona.

244
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,400
Bring it back!

245
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,120
Ah you punk! That punk! Bring it back!

246
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,890
Bring it here!

247
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:51,680
- I love you. Ah this punk.<br>- I. Love.You!

248
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,460
What kind of love is this?!

249
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,810
Why...

250
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,910
You punk!

251
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:05,400
- Let's stop this now.<br> - Stop what?! What?!

252
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,340
Why would you run away with this? Ah this punk, really.

253
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
- I love you.<br> - You don't have to love me.

254
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,340
Oh it's such a relief.

255
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,680
Unni, the Professor didn't come today, so Teaching Assistant Heo came in.

256
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,060
So Eun Taek took the roll book, and flew away with it.

257
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,590
- Yeah, I saw Eun Taek.<br> - Oh! Where did you see him?

258
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,800
- Ah ah ah! I'm sorry<br>- Get in here! Get in here, you punk!<br>- Ah, I'm sorry.

259
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,550
- Go take your seat, now.<br>- Oh, I'm very sorry.

260
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,420
- Why would you take that. <br> - Aww...

261
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:43,660
Servant you set an achievement.

262
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,600
- You're not sorry at all. I mean why would you take this?<br><i>-What?</i>

263
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,420
You should behave even better when the professor's not around.

264
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,400
Now. I'll do roll call again.

265
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,190
- Kang Seung Beom!<br> - Here.

266
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,160
<i>Oh Yeo Ji.</i>

267
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,500
<i>After the incident at the beginning of semester party,</i>

268
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,780
<i>Sunbae began skillfully manipulating others</i>

269
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:08,910
<i>to harass me to no end.</i>

270
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,010
You should have been careful.

271
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,670
<i>That... was when I could feel it for sure.</i>

272
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,320
<i>A certain malicious intent towards me.</i>

273
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,350
<i>All because of one person, my school life became hell.</i>

274
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:55,960
<i>So that is why I decided to take time off from school.</i>

275
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,020
Look at your complexion. But at least you're hanging in there.

276
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,480
You should take a day off from part-time work on a day like this.

277
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,430
I have to go back to work soon.

278
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:15,150
Do you remember talking about taking a leave from school while drinking last night?

279
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,750
- What?<br> - I knew you wouldn't remember. <br>- I've gone crazy.

280
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,390
Here, take it. It's some spare money I'm not using. Use it towards your tuition.

281
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,090
You're crazy. It's money that you've been putting away for a year to go backpacking.

282
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,890
No it's not. It's only been for 10 months.

283
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,690
- You...<br> - Take it!

284
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,590
Is school some kind of stepping-stone or something, that you're jumping here and there?

285
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,660
If you take time off now, do you know how old you'll be when you graduate?

286
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,580
For women, age is a part of their qualifications.

287
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,330
- You're crazy! How can I accept this?<br> - I said take it!

288
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:54,230
I really want to go to school together with you!

289
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:57,370
- I feel the same way!<br> - Take it!

290
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,550
It's not because of money!

291
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,270
I guess it is because of money!

292
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:08,590
Oh, Eun Taek. What is it?

293
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,480
Whaat? It's a real lucky strike.

294
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,990
Okay. Alright. I got it. Bye.

295
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,830
- What? Did something good happen to Eun Taek?

296
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:26,220
- Should I tell you or not...?<br>- Tell me!

297
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,170
You're the recipient of the full-tuition scholarship.

298
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,680
Miss Hong Seol, I said you got the full-tuition scholarship!

299
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:41,100
How can something like this... happen?

300
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:45,870
A year of my part-time job wages fell from the sky just now.

301
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,010
Is it the will of Heaven?

302
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,990
But how can I go to school with that guy?

303
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,700
Hong!

304
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,040
Noona.

305
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,020
Let's go quickly, okay?

306
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,890
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

307
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,940
Why? Why are we hurrying?

308
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,530
Let's run!

309
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,970
Why are we running? We still have plenty of time!

310
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,170
If we don't run, there's no room.

311
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,600
Oh right, we need to secure the seats in the computer room!

312
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,580
There's no way that'll happen, it'll be okay!

313
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,670
Do you really want to be running around all semester? Just run!!

314
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,720
Run quickly!

315
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
Look behind us!

316
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,940
Hurry up! Bora!

317
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,010
I feel like I'm about to fall. Wait up for me!

318
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:40,020
Wait up for me!

319
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,330
Arg...I'm so tired. There are too few monitors.

320
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,980
Turn on your computer first, hurry.

321
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,030
Okay.

322
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,680
Nothing else really matters, but we need to take Professor Han's class so put that in as your first choice.

323
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,420
Of course I know. If we take Professor Kang's class, we're all dead.

324
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,420
Did you open up the atomic clock?

325
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,950
Yeah. I did it.

326
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,130
We can't click it fast or we can't click it too late. We have to click it at exactly 9 o'clock sharp.

327
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:12,780
Here we go Noonas. Your one and only life during the semester, depends on your pointer finger, so please warm them up.

328
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,560
Okay.

329
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,990
A little faster!

330
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,340
What the!

331
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,450
Ugh, the server actually seems to have gone down.

332
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,210
Stay right there. Don't click "reset" okay?

333
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,110
- Hey, hey, hey. <br>- If you do that, you're doomed.

334
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,320
Sunbae, why is it like this?

335
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,250
- Let go of me.<br>- I'm actually going crazy.

336
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,740
It's working! Yes!<br><i>Term Page Msg: Normal Registration has been completed</i>

337
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,800
- Sunbae is it working? It's working!<br> - Okay, okay

338
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,270
Mine's not working.

339
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
- My power went off...<br><i>- Okay!</i>

340
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,930
<i>It's not working yet?</i>

341
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,200
Did you get Professor Han's class?

342
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,000
- I did it!<br><i>- Success! Success!</i>

343
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,160
Well, the others I can take time to pick...

344
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,260
My other classes are all being postponed?

345
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:59,660
- Do another class. Execute Plan B. Plan B.<br>- C'mon you have to help me.

346
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:01,530
Then do Plan C.

347
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,300
Guys, I think I failed.

348
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,790
I have first period for three days.

349
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,900
Ah, that was refreshing.

350
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,050
Refreshing? It seems like I have to take a break from the semester.

351
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,600
Why? At least you got into Professor Han's class.

352
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,040
She's right. That's quite an achievement.

353
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,250
Professor Han's class is the ONLY good one. Look at the other classes. They're the definition of doom.

354
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:25,060
Yeah, I would've rested a semester if I were you, too.

355
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,110
What is this? You don't have first period classes at all? Look at hers!

356
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:34,900
We ran together and banged the keyboard together just the same just now,

357
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,770
but why is yours so pretty?

358
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:40,190
No, it's because your finger is so short–

359
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,570
Hey! Hey! You want to die?

360
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,730
I feel so wronged to top it off. <br>- Oh look! It's Sunbae Yoo Jeong! Sunbae Yoo Jeong!

361
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:45,510
Hello.

362
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,690
Oh Jeong! You came?

363
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,240
You came, Sunbae?

364
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,210
Oh, Hooba Hong, I heard you got the full-tuition scholarship.

365
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,960
Wow, you're lucky. Buy us some food.

366
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,130
She should. Since she got that due to Yoo Jeong Sunbae.

367
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,660
She should treat everyone to meat about ten times.

368
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,690
- Yeah.<br> - Nam Joo Yeon, what are you saying?

369
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,460
Didn't you know? Because Teaching Assistant Heo, lost Sunbae Yoo Jeong's report,

370
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,560
the scholarship was passed onto Seol instead.

371
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,800
On a day like this, wouldn't it be nice if we all ate meat together?

372
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,000
Treat everyone to beef.

373
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,510
- Sunbae.<br>- Yeah<br>- I'll treat everyone to beef.

374
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,490
But I want to eat the beef that Seol buys.

375
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,900
- Oh, Sunbae. It's my treat.<br>- Yeah sure

376
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,680
Nice to see you, Seol.

377
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,050
Wow, so she got the full-tuition scholarship?

378
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:34,080
Daebak. What is going on?

379
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,420
<i>Because of that human, I had such a tough time last year, and even considered taking a leave from school.</i>

380
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:46,070
<i>But thanks to that human, I am able to go back to school?</i>

381
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,010
<i>What is going on?</i>

382
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,290
<i>I feel like I'm being sucked into something.</i>

383
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,290
<i>Oh, I don't feel good about this...</i>

384
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,670
Hey, Seol.

385
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,080
What are you doing?

386
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,060
I'm just looking at my class schedule.

387
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,030
I'm finished.

388
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,350
I'm happy to see you again.

389
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:18,030
Want to eat lunch with me?

390
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,550
Huh?!

391
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,460
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

392
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,260
No.

393
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,960
I don't usually eat lunch.

394
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,060
<i>Seol's Class Schedule</i>

395
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,620
What is this? What the heck?

396
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,480
Did I do something wrong again?

397
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,490
<i>No one else might know, but I know.</i>

398
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,550
I haven't, though.

399
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:57,450
<i>That scary face hidden behind that fake smile.</i>

400
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,030
Hong! where are you going?

401
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,800
Didn't you meet Sunbae?

402
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,690
- How do you know about that?<br> - I told him.

403
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,500
Hey!

404
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,980
You met him. What did he say?

405
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,880
He asked me to lunch.

406
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,770
Looks like Sunbae wants to start getting along with you this semester, and offered to treat you to lunch.

407
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,820
He's being magnanimous.

408
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,250
Magnanimous, my butt.

409
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,830
What? Did you run away again?

410
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,260
Aigoo, since you always run away here and there, he must have been frustrated.

411
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,060
Hey, you're probably the only person who dislikes him in our major.

412
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,470
Look at that Nam Joo Yeon, Nam Joo Yeon.

413
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,100
She's stuck to him and flirting with him all day long, saying, "Sunbae... Sunbae..."

414
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,510
No, Sunbae Yoo Jeong just wanted to eat with Seol, but

415
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,240
Noona Seol is just overreacting and drinking the <i>kimchee stew (drinking kimchee stew = counting your chickens before the eggs hatch)</i>

416
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,260
<i>"Oh, maybe Yoo Jeong likes me? Oh maybe, we will date?"</i>

417
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,970
<i>Your novel is no fun, you know.</i>

418
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,370
No, she's overreacting.

419
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,510
Don't drink the <i>kimchee stew</i> first.

420
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,360
Let's just eat already. I'm hungry.

421
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,110
<i>Should've said so when Sunbae had</i>

422
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,630
<i>offered to buy you lunch.</i>

423
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,970
♬<i> Please call after me again, <i>♬</i></i>

424
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,550
♬<i> Raise your hand so I can recognize you right away. </i>♬

425
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,250
♬<i> What other words are needed. </i>♬

426
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:11,770

427
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,080

428
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,610
- Buy us a meal, Sunbae! <br> - Hold on just a minute.<br>♬ <i> we, </i> ♬

429
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,600
Sunbae Sang Cheol!<br>♬ <i> What can be done</i> ♬

430
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:22,530
It's a relief that we got into this class.

431
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,360
Look at all these people. This classroom is bursting.

432
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,830
I'll bet half of them are people who didn't get in, but are here to beg their way in.

433
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:34,880
See? Wasn't it good that we ran when I said we should?

434
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,010
Teacher Hong Seol.

435
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,960
Hello.

436
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,820
Wow, there are so many of you. Some of you are even sitting on the stairs.

437
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,120
Maybe we need to borrow the main auditorium, or something.

438
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,660
Looks like there are quite a few of you who couldn't register for this class.

439
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,950
Will you raise your hands?

440
00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:01,180
I would love to make room for all of you,

441
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:03,690
but as you can see, having class like this is difficult,

442
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,070
So when I call roll, those whose names are not called, please leave before class begins.

443
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,290
I know that Professor Kang's class is quite good.

444
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,110
- Nah<br> - Oh no, it's packed, and

445
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,990
you will learn a lot.

446
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:19,430
She's a better person than I am, so it will be good to learn from her, too.

447
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:23,280
From now, I will refuse anyone who begs me in my research room.

448
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,160
Especially the pretty young female students, I will particularly refuse them.

449
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Then I will begin roll call.

450
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,060
- Nam Joo Yeon.<br> - Here.

451
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,180
- Jang Bo Ra.<br> - Here.

452
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,460
- Yoo Jeong.<br> - Here.

453
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,190
- Choi Ji Yeon.<br> - Here.

454
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,770
- Ham Yi Jin.<br> - Here.

455
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,480
- Heo Kyung Joo.<br> - Here.

456
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,560
Okay, I finished roll call.

457
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,770
- Now I'll begin class. <br> - Why didn't he call you?

458
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,600
Ask him. You might be marked absent.

459
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,440
Professor.

460
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,010
You didn't call my name.

461
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,530
What is your name?

462
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,840
I'm a Junior, and my name is Hong Seol.

463
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,810
You're not in here. Are you sure you registered for this class?

464
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,770
- We did it together.<br>- Yeah

465
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:16,440
Is that so? Then go ahead an attend lecture today, and let's find out what happened later.

466
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,330
- What is this? It doesn't feel right.<br>- <i>Now we will begin...</i>

467
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,820
Didn't we register at that time?

468
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,260
I even have it on my schedule.

469
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,940
I know.

470
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,150
This is your name, right?

471
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,740
Come look.

472
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:35,290
You see it? "schedule modification: delete". It's right here.

473
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,050
- Why are you being... <br>- But that can't be true.

474
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,010
Just go already.

475
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,290
It's possible that something went...wrong.

476
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,120
Hey, the phone is ringing.

477
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,520
I-I'm sorry, could I make sure once more–

478
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,020
No. Hello?

479
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,870
Yes.

480
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:49,560
Class registration is closed, so nothing can be done.

481
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,300
<i>Just once, just once</i>

482
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,060
You can call the professor directly then.

483
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,120
What? Aish?

484
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,070
Hey, what is your name?

485
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,820
Hey hey hey, I dare you to come here and say that.

486
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,030
If you're not going to come, then don't call me, you punk!

487
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,000
N-Never mind, thank you.

488
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:09,500
How can something like this happen?

489
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,620
So someone stole your ID and password

490
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,680
and dropped that class?

491
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,850
But how did anyone know her password?

492
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:20,670
Maybe someone saw while she logged in.

493
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,890
So that person canceled her class and registered that class for him/herself.

494
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,800
- Noona what time did you say that it was?<br>- Weird.

495
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,390
Oh, Ha Jae Woo? Did you get a new notebook computer?

496
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,670
What business is it of yours?

497
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:35,980
In any case, we have to catch the criminal and let everyone under heaven know.

498
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:38,520
Such people need to be publicly called out to come to their senses.

499
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,300
Honestly, for someone like me who's taking Professor Kang's class, which you hate so much, hearing that makes me feel bad.

500
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,390
Why are you suspecting everyone just because of her?

501
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,070
Because something suspicious happened is why I'm being suspicious.

502
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,000
Geez, you just got to have the last word.

503
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,740
Last word... being so self-righteous.

504
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,860
Honestly, all you need to do is just take another class.

505
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:58,910
I don't know why you're causing such commotion over something that is not a big deal.

506
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:03,720
I understand that you're obsessed with your grades, but you shouldn't suspect innocent people. It's quite offensive.

507
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,540
Hey, Nam Joo Yeon. Didn't you come early in the morning to register for Professor Han's class for the same reason?

508
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,780
Looks like you suspect that someone purposely dropped you from Professor Han's class.

509
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:17,280
Don't suspect people without any evidence.

510
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,330
Looks like that's your hobby since last year.

511
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,700
Hey, are you finished!

512
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,630
How dare she pretend that she's so above it all, that unlucky ball!

513
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,690
Oh, really.

514
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,750
Just wait until this person gets caught. I will let them have it.

515
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,020
<i>Yes, I want to be cool and just laugh it off.</i>

516
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:44,250
<i>But it will be harder to get the scholarship again if I attend Professor Kang's class,</i>

517
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:47,700
<i>and then I have to take another leave next semester.</i>

518
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,650
<i>Oh, things are so twisted.</i>

519
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:58,250
<i>But, if the time that the class was canceled was around 12 PM,</i>

520
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,980
<i>then that was while I was in the library.</i>

521
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,290
<i>Seol. Seol.</i>

522
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,470
- S-Sunbae. <br> - You're in this class too?

523
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:14,530
Yes. But, why are you here?

524
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,120
I thought this class will be more roomy.

525
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,840
It must be the same for you.

526
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,870
It must be.

527
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,440
- It was.<br> - How fun.

528
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,390
Fun. Yeah, right.

529
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:48,340
<i>How are we in the same class? Could this be a coincidence?</i>

530
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:52,170
<i>Wouldn't someone have watched when she logged in?</i>

531
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,330
<i>No way. No.</i>

532
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,620
<i>That person could definitely have done that.</i>

533
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,920
You're all done with classes today, right?

534
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,890
- Want to have dinner together?<br> - No.

535
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,010
Why? Do I make you uncomfortable?

536
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,540
No, it's not that.

537
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,510
I was going to meet with Professor Han to appeal to him.

538
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,240
Your course registration got cancelled, didn't it?

539
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,100
It seems like someone cancelled it intentionally.

540
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,860
There isn't anyone you suspect?

541
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,720
I'm not too sure yet.

542
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,760
But, I'll definitely catch them. For sure.

543
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,090
I'll be going.

544
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,030
There are about 80 people, and I can't enter

545
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,850
all the student ID's individually.

546
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,070
Okay, I can do it. But

547
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,880
- all it will show is a list of legitimate cancellations.<br> - Isn't there any other way?

548
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,790
There is a security team, but even there

549
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,150
all you will get is a list of IP's from where they logged in.

550
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:19,480
We can't find out who the culprit is this way.

551
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,170
I have a favor to ask.

552
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:29,120
I understand your situation, but right now, there's really nothing I can do.

553
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,760
I have heard that a few more students can enroll at your request.

554
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,710
Please do me this favor. I really want to take your class.

555
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:43,160
Ah, jeez. This is why I tell pretty students not to come here.

556
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,800
Aigoo, is that something a professor should say?

557
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,170
- Hello.<br> - Oh, sure.

558
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:51,620
My class has some spots left.

559
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,500
What? Mine is also required for your major, anyway. Take my class.

560
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,080
Why? You don't want to take mine?

561
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,670
- No, it's not that.<br> - If it's not that, then why?

562
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:09,270
Oh, you must be scared because it is a witch's class, right?

563
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:13,510
Witch Kang, right? It seems the students call me Witch Kang.

564
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,240
Good gracious.

565
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,740
It's because you guys don't know me.

566
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,410
I am an extremely nice and gentle woman.

567
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:24,700
- Why are you laughing?<br> - No, it's just...

568
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,700
In any case, I think it'll be difficult to add you to my class.

569
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,840
Go ahead and enroll in Professor Kang's class.

570
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,830
Yes. If you really get to know her, you'll see that she is a nice and gentle woman.

571
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,320
You'll learn a lot from her.

572
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,050
- You'll treat this student well, right?<br> - Ah, yes, of course.

573
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,160
I'm always good to my students.

574
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,520
What is your name?

575
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,310
It's Hong Seol.

576
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:53,210
Hong Seol? Omo, your name is so pretty.

577
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:55,850
Let's do a good job.

578
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,030
- Yes.<br> - Have some.

579
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:05,370
The third and second lecture on Tuesday, so international Trade doesn't fit...

580
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:09,820
I'm ruined. I was ruined from the start.

581
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,610
Yoo Jeong, that bastard, seriously.

582
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,760
Welcome...

583
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,360
<i>How did he know I work here?</i>

584
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,080
I'll take your order.

585
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,240
- I'll have one Americano and a strawberry shake.<br> - Strawberry shake?

586
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,120
That'll be 8,000 won.

587
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,590
- Do you want the receipt?<br> - No.

588
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,430
Here you go.

589
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,440
That's yours.

590
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,190
Here you go.

591
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,310
That's yours.

592
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,460
<i>- Now, what is this supposed to mean?</i><br> - What the heck?

593
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:40,870
Hello? Oh, Soo Gyeong? Why aren't you coming?

594
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,900
- Min Gyeong Wan?<br> - Yes.<br> - Kim Sang Cheol?<br> - Yes.

595
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,910
You got an F last semester, right? Let's do better.

596
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,980
- Go Min Soo?<br> -Yes.<br> - Hong Seol?

597
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,320
Hong Seol?

598
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:07,230
About what you're most curious about, grades.

599
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,560
Attendance 20%, mid-terms 50%.

600
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,480
Group projects 20%, individual projects 10%.

601
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:19,080
And about the group presentations, one for the midterm and one for the final, so two in total.

602
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:24,140
What's wrong? Did you come into my class without knowing this?

603
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,980
I thought you'd know it all.

604
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,460
You all want to go somewhere and take a comfortable and relaxed class, right?

605
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:33,730
Look somewhere else. Everyone, come to your senses.

606
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:36,590
If you do that, your lives will become leisurely.

607
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,940
In today's recession, do you want your life to be a failure?

608
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,500
Of course not.

609
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,080
Who is it?

610
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,180
- I apologize.<br> - If you're sorry, then hurry and come in.

611
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,560
You're tardy.

612
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,360
Listen carefully. Three tardies equal one absence.

613
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,810
If you get three absences, that is an automatic fail for this class.

614
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,660
Even though we just began this semester,

615
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:04,480
I will always check attendance. Is that clear?

616
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,920
- Hong Seol?<br> - Yes?<br> - You have one tardy.

617
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,850
Hong Seol? What about your textbook?

618
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,560
You came unprepared. Yes?

619
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,460
Everyone, open your textbooks.

620
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,000
Look at this, look at all of you.

621
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:35,350
You didn't hear anything about my class?

622
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,480
I start teaching from the very first class.

623
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,190
You must bring your textbook to class.

624
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:43,660
To anyone who doesn't bring their book next time,

625
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,380
you will need to retake this class, like Sang Cheol in the back.

626
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,410
Now, open your books.

627
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,480
- Let's get started.<br> - Can we look together?

628
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,240
<i>One day he suddenly became the King of England.</i>

629
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,860
To get targeted by Witch Kang...

630
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,860
But seeing that guy in the morning ruined my mood, seriously.

631
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,790
Seol.

632
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:29,260
- Who? <br> - Oh, I am Min Soo, Son Min Soo.

633
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,880
I have something to tell you.

634
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:41,400
Perhaps... I'm just saying perhaps...

635
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:43,970
I saw it.

636
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:49,280
The day we applied for classes, and you used the computer here

637
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,220
the person who used it after you did.

638
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:55,650
Who was it?

639
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,850
<i>Seol. What are you doing?</i>

640
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:04,250
<i>Ehm... Just checking my class schedule.</i>

641
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,640
<i>I'm done looking.</i>

642
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,600
Sunbae Yoo again?

643
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,020
Can you really trust her? You don't remember last year?

644
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:40,680
You suspected that Yoo Jeong uploaded that stuff about Sang Cheol and totally got screwed.

645
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,880
I think you should be a little more careful.

646
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,510
If you accuse people carelessly, you could be totally ostracized.

647
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,310
Do you like Yoo Jeong that much? You want to see him so much that you have to check the CCTV?

648
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,400
You little...

649
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,330
I'm going to look by myself.

650
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,020
- Why are you being so cold?<br> - Go, go, go.

651
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,960
Are you really suspecting me?

652
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:15,780
Since you aren't answering, I guess you are.

653
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,890
If you didn't do it, then tell me you didn't.

654
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:26,050
Fine. Let's meet at 6 in front of the library.

655
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,850
We can check the CCTV footage together.

656
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,930
Oh, right, this.

657
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:35,460
I didn't know you two were here, so I only brought one for Seol.

658
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,680
- No, it's okay.<br> - It's okay.

659
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,620
Hey, you wench. It looks like it really wasn't him. What are you going to do?

660
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,960
Ah, seriously.

661
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,850
Do you like him?

662
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,170
I guess you do like him.

663
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,360
Hey, you drink this.

664
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,510
Oh, it's cold, it's cold.

665
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,220
Will something change if I listen to that lecture?

666
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,560
Of course it will. He is the God of Business. You have to.

667
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,210
- That person's salary must be no joke. <br> - Hello?

668
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,300
Joo Yeon.

669
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,650
I don't think I'll be able to go to the lecture.

670
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:28,600
<i>Why? Everyone's here waiting.</i>

671
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,680
I have an appointment with Seol. We are going to check the library's CCTV together.

672
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,170
I think we can catch the culprit who deleted Seol's course.

673
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:39,570
<i>But, why do you have to check the CCTV footage with Seol?</i>

674
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,120
<i>Then, what about the lecture?</i>

675
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:46,270
Since we're meeting at 6PM, I'll see if I have still have time. I'm hanging up.

676
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,860
<i>Seol, CCTV? What's going on?</i>

677
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:51,490
Looks like we can't eat meat anymore after this lecture.

678
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:54,670
I canceled my plans since we were supposed to eat meat. Let's go.

679
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,850
Let's just go.

680
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,320
- Hello.<br> - Ah, yes.

681
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,480
You've been working hard, haven't you?

682
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,310
<i>The call cannot be connected, after the tone...</i>

683
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:12,970
It's past 6 and Sunbae Yoo Jeong isn't answering his phone.

684
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:16,570
Is there something up like you said there was?

685
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:22,030
Let's stop waiting around and leave.

686
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,770
But, will they show us the CCTV footage? I'm worried about that.

687
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,790
I have a good idea. Let's go.

688
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,920
- You're not using me again, are you?<br> - Just come in.

689
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,290
What is it?

690
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,520
My dad burned everything else.

691
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:42,030
That one picture was the only thing I had left.

692
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:47,230
No matter how hard it got, I could endure because of that picture.

693
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,130
Ajusshi, I have to find my wallet.

694
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:56,970
If I lose that, what am I going to look at when I miss my mom?

695
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,970
Ah, seriously.

696
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,960
Ajusshi, please. Yes?

697
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,920
Look quickly.

698
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,300
I'll go do a round.

699
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:12,450
Okay, we'll take care of it. Thank you.

700
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,980
Here. Hey.

701
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,730
Right here.

702
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:18,090
What did you say the date was?

703
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,330
February 16th. Around 11:52 AM.

704
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,010
52 minutes. Here it is.

705
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,300
- Where were you seated then? <br> - Here in that corner.

706
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:31,530
What? It's a blind spot. Why of all places, it had to be there?

707
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:34,710
Then, we can just check who came in and out.

708
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,780
Let's turn it back to 11:40.

709
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,560
Is there something?

710
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,110
Ah, here's Sunbae Yoo Jeong.

711
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,340
He was continuously looking at you.

712
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,160
He's getting closer and closer.

713
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,680
Then, right about now... "Want to go eat?"

714
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,940
"No, I already ate."

715
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,110
- "Then, what about coffee?"<br> - "I drank coffee too." Did you avoid him like this?

716
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:00,510
Something like that.

717
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:02,910
You were talking.

718
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,990
Oh, you ran out.

719
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,540
Did you log out?

720
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,790
You didn't? Ah, seriously.

721
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:13,890
- I guess not.<br> - But, Sunbae Yoo Jeong is just standing here.

722
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:15,860
Right, he's not going out.

723
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:18,590
- No way.<br> - No way.

724
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,520
Sunbae Yoo Jeong didn't delete it, did he?

725
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,990
For now, just watch. Oh, he's going out.

726
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:28,880
Wait, what time... 11:45? 11:45?

727
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,520
Hey, then, it wasn't Sunbae! You said it happened at 11:53.

728
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,480
What are you always like that since last year? It's not like you have a trauma related to him.

729
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:39,390
How are you going to face Sunbae?

730
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:42,350
Ajusshi, I think I need to look a bit more and we can see it.

731
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,500
- Ah, students, if you keep doing this, I'll get in trouble. <br> - Ah, Ahjusshi!

732
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,170
Forget it, forget it. Get out, get out.

733
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,650
Hurry up.

734
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,980
Why did you do it?

735
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,190
What did I do?

736
00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:04,280
Then, Sunbae...

737
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,960
Why were you there at that time?

738
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,380
<i>Jeong.</i>

739
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,910
Then, what about you? Why were you there?

740
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,380
I was curious who made Seol that way.

741
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:40,270
I got the IP from TA Heo. It was the computer Seol was using in the library.

742
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:44,850
So I found the CCTV footage.

743
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,640
Jeong, I did wrong.

744
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,350
This once... Just this once, let it go.

745
00:46:54,350 --> 00:47:00,540
If you pretend you don't know, we can move on as if nothing has happened.

746
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,920
I didn't do it on purpose. <br><i> I went to use the computer.</i>

747
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:12,230
<i>Someone didn't log out. And it was Hong.</i>

748
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,130
I was just going to turn it off.

749
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,260
Jeong, you also know that I had to retake that class.

750
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:24,560
If I take Professor Kang's class and fail again,

751
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,410
let alone graduating, I won't be able to get a job.

752
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,470
I was... I was really desperate at that time.

753
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,120
You should have said that to Seol.

754
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,040
Ah, this is unfair for me, too.

755
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,790
I deleted the class and was about to register,

756
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,250
but some other bastard took the spot.

757
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,240
It was like I "made porridge and gave it to the dog." (I.e., did something for nothing.)

758
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,610
Jeong, it was really wrong of me to do that.

759
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:57,900
If this gets out, I'd seriously be too embarrassed to come to school.

760
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,060
Seriously.

761
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:04,530
I'll do anything you want, just tell me what you want.

762
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,560
But...

763
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:12,930
We should change the CCTV locations in our school.

764
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:14,190
Huh?

765
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,040
That spot happened to be in a blind spot.

766
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,190
I knew you walked in and out,

767
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:24,030
but I had no idea what you did there.

768
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:30,120
Did you... just play me?

769
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,310
No way.

770
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,690
I didn't know either.

771
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:40,430
That you...

772
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,260
would tell me everything.

773
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,630
Hey, Jeong, you...

774
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,420
Ah, who could it be?

775
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,380
That's what I was saying. We couldn't catch the culprit. It's so frustrating.

776
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:06,760
I'm going home first.

777
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:11,730
You're not going to eat dinner with us? We should eat together!

778
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:15,270
- Go safely.<br> - Take care.

779
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,720
<i>If it wasn't Sunbae, then who could it be?</i>

780
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:27,110
<i>Was it really not Sunbae?</i>

781
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:47,930
Did you find the culprit?

782
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:50,370
Why didn't you come?

783
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:53,850
Do you still think I'm the culprit?

784
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:57,020
Why didn't you tell me that you didn't do it?

785
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,160
If I told you I didn't, would you have believed me?

786
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,660
<i>No, I wouldn't have believed you.</i>

787
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:12,280
<i> Why did you give up on the scholarship? Why did you take the same class as I did? </i>

788
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:16,660
<i>I have so many things to ask you,</i>

789
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,390
<i>but I don't have the confidence to trust your answers just yet.</i>

790
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:25,800
I'm sorry. It looks like I misunderstood this time.

791
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,530
Is that all?

792
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,870
What?

793
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:33,060
Want to eat dinner together?

794
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:35,130
No.

795
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,930
I don't eat dinner.

796
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:42,700
I'm sorry.

797
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:47,580
<i>♫ Your heart ♫</i>

798
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,180
<i> ♫ falls down along a rose vine. ♫ </i>

799
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:58,000
<i> ♫ Oh that feeling, I ♫ </i>

800
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,720
<i> ♫ want to touch it. ♫ </i>

801
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:06,720
<i>That was how class registration period ended.<br>♫ I want to sing. Oh I ♫ </i>

802
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,660
<i>I couldn't find the culprit in the end, but whoever it was,</i>

803
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,420
<i>it must have been someone more desperate than me.</i>

804
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,660
<i>That's what I decided to think.</i>

805
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:27,460
Let's put in tuna.

806
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,690
Hello?

807
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:48,600
Yeah, Mom.

808
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,710
Am I a child? Don't worry.

809
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,520
Of course I'm eating well.

810
00:51:55,520 --> 00:52:00,140
Right now I'm eating hoedopbap with tuna <br><i>(steamed rice with vegetables and raw fish)</i>

811
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:05,910
Oh, raw tuna is the most expensive!

812
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:09,050
I got calls from a few places.

813
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:11,450
I'm choosing between them right now.

814
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,070
Your son has to work for a big conglomerate.

815
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,570
Yeah, don't worry too much, Mom. Yeah.

816
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:22,630
Mom, hey, send me some kimchi. Give me kimchi.

817
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,580
Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Mom. Okay.

818
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,150
Hey, In Ha! Wait a minute!

819
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:54,450
Thanks. Stay healthy. Bye.

820
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,250
Hey, Baek... Hey, Baek In Ha!

821
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:58,720
Seriously, what's with you?

822
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:02,430
I did everything you wanted. Are you a con artist?

823
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,710
Are you crazy?

824
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:07,730
In the time I went with you I increased your prestige. I acted charming and

825
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,720
I did everything. Don't you know to give and take?

826
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,970
You little...

827
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:17,590
Hey, forget it. Did you think that men didn't care about a woman's money and job?

828
00:53:17,590 --> 00:53:22,410
You're 26 years old, but you do nothing other than latch onto men.

829
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,310
- You bastard, is that all you can say!!! <br>- Are you asking if she is a slut?

830
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:27,860
I must have crap in my ears because I can't stand listening to this.

831
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:28,850
What are you?

832
00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:32,930
What kind of guy follows a woman around like that? What did you eat that made you into such a loser?

833
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:35,430
Even this raggedy bastard too now.

834
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:37,310
Are you going to take this to the very end?

835
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:39,100
From now on, don't live like that.

836
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,680
You crazy bastard.

837
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,760
This bastard.

838
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:45,260
Open the door, bastard!

839
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:47,410
Hey, stop right there!

840
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,420
That crazy bastard! That bastard!

841
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,070
You're over if I catch you!

842
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,410
All you deserve is the middle finger!

843
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:55,260
You b*lless bas****!

844
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,890
Your temper hasn't died down, Baek In Ho.

845
00:53:56,890 --> 00:53:59,290
You're also the same.

846
00:53:59,290 --> 00:54:02,250
- Except that you're older. <br> - You are also...

847
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:05,390
You look even more like a bum than before.

848
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:15,330
Oh, it smells like a widower's house. You smoke in here, do you?

849
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:19,890
But, why do you live here?

850
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:22,150
Did you get kicked out?

851
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:24,500
Kicked out? Who got kicked out?

852
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,350
The president gave me this place. He set me up on my own.

853
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,010
You didn't get your place on your own, you ignorant fool.

854
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:33,130
That's that.

855
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:34,750
But, how did you know I live here?

856
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:37,340
I went to your school and said I was your younger brother.

857
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:38,490
They said you quit school.

858
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:41,310
What's the point of going to school? It's not like I'm getting a job.

859
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:44,780
Are you quitting school and the best you can do is to scam men?

860
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:46,030
You're funny.

861
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:50,090
- Pathetic fool. <br> - You ran off before. Why do you care?

862
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:53,710
When I was dissing school you were cutting out. What do you care?

863
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,710
- Because you're being pathetic. <br> - You are even more pathetic.

864
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,980
Why did you come? You played enough for five years?

865
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:05,200
Anyway, at a glance of what you're wearing from head to toe it's size. Size!

866
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,580
- I should just...<br> - Ah, I got it.

867
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,770
Did you come to get money from Chairman?

868
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:14,410
- Under the pretext of doctor's fees, physical therapy fees, it will be nice. Very nice. You'll pull out living expenses—<br>- Baek In Ha!

869
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:16,830
Shut your mouth. How old you are that you're still--

870
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:19,480
That's why you can't do it.

871
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,770
What changes if you have pride?

872
00:55:21,770 --> 00:55:24,960
As much as you have rolled around on the ground, you know, don't you?

873
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,620
That's right. I'm the crazy bastard for being curious enough to look for his sister.

874
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,790
How did I end up with a sister like you?

875
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:38,240
Did you meet with Jeong?

876
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,370
He changed a lot.

877
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:48,620
Enough time has passed. Do you think Jeong has been at peace?

878
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:52,040
Why? Should I call him for you?

879
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,570
Ridiculous.

880
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:12,360
Jeong!

881
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:16,520
In Ho came. Oh! You were surprised, right?

882
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,400
That's right. We should hang out all three of us.

883
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,480
Oh, it's exam period?

884
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:26,620
Then it'll be hard to make time.

885
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:31,710
I got it. Yeah, I'll tell In Ho.

886
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:37,830
He says that he has exams. I guess he misses you.

887
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:40,860
- Try looking for Jeong.<br>- Don't be ridiculous. What bullsh*t.

888
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,120
It's up to you if you believe or not.

889
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,630
Even if you leave, wouldn't it make you feel better to see him once?

890
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:50,000
Jeong goes to Yeonhui University, majoring in business.

891
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,660
Where are you going?

892
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:56,050
Why isn't this bastard answering?

893
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:03,060
<i>Jeong! In Ho came!</i>

894
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:06,960
<i> Why aren't you answering? It's been a while since we've hung out. </i>

895
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,710
<i>Just like old times, hm?</i>

896
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,970
- Cha Min Young? <br> - Yes.

897
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,670
- Ha Jae Woo?<br> - Yes.

898
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,600
- Hong Seol?<br> - Yes!

899
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,960
<i> Since the situation became like this, I might as well work hard. </i>

900
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,630
<i> There's surely something I will learn. </i>

901
00:57:27,630 --> 00:57:30,620
<i> Where else won't I see that Sunbae's face. </i>

902
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:32,570
Yoo Jeong, what brings you here?

903
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,780
- I'm sorry.<br> - Huh?

904
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,500
Wait a minute.

905
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:46,760
Your name is not on the class list.

906
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:50,490
I switched. I thought this class would be more fun.

907
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:53,690
Oh, okay. It's good to see you.

908
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:57,040
Of course, students who are wise take my class.

909
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,220
Now, shall we start the class?

910
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,600
Strategic Management, page 12.

911
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,280
Seol, hi.

912
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:15,000
<i>What's with this guy?!</i>

913
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:27,600
<i> Timing and Subtitles by the I'm Trapped Team @ viki. com </i>

914
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,840
<i> A suspicious Sunbae has started to act suspiciously. </i>

915
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,950
<i>Why? Do I bother you? You also really bother me.</i>

916
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:48,580
<i>- Are you close with Sunbae?<br> - We're not close. We're not close at all.</i>

917
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,410
<i>Seol. Seol. Seol. Seol, want to go eat?</i>

918
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:54,780
<i> - Eat with me. <br> - Is this person food deprived or what? </i>

919
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,840
<i> Get yourself together, Hong Seol. You shouldn't get fooled by that smile. </i>

920
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,070
<i> That person is cunning like a snake. </i>

921
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:04,390
<i> I can't figure out what those wicked people are thinking about. </i>

922
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,140
<i>Don't be so happy that Sunbae is showing interest in you.</i>

923
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,310
<i>Because Sunbae is friendly to anyone.</i>

924
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,710
<i>You've never had any particular interest.</i>

925
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:14,210
<i> - Pathetic fool. <br> - He still feels guilty... </i>

926
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:18,520
<i> Look at your face. Feeling no guilt after ruining someone's life. </i>

927
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,530
<i> Feel guilty? Why should I? </i>

928
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:21,390
<i>Hey, come over here.</i>

929
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:24,470
<i> He likes you. You're the only one who treats him that way. </i>

930
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,250
<i>Me?</i>

931
00:59:27,070 --> 00:59:28,390
<i> I'm saying this because I'm worried. </i>

932
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:31,430
<i> Seol is in danger right now. <br> - Don't worry, nothing will happen. </i>

933
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:34,690
<i> It's a different feeling than what I've felt before. </i>

934
00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:36,510
<i>Is he being sincere?</i>

935
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:40,070
<i>Ugh, I really don't know anymore.</i>
